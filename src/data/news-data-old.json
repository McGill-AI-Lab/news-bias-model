Trump raged at his military and legal advisers, calling them losers for objecting to his idea of using federal troops to suppress outbreaks of violence during the nationwide protests over the police murder of George Floyd.It wasnt the only time Mr. Trump was talked out of using the military for domestic law enforcement  a practice that would carry profound implications for civil liberties and for the traditional constraints on federal power. He repeatedly raised the idea of using troops to secure border states, and even proposed shooting both violent protesters and undocumented migrants in the legs, former aides have said.In his first term in office, Mr. Trump never realized his expansive vision of using troops to enforce the law on U.S. soil. But as he has sought a return to power, he has made clear that he intends to use the military for a range of domestic law enforcement purposes, including patrolling the border, suppressing protests that he deems to have turned into riots and even fighting crime in big cities run by Democrats.In places where there is a true breakdown of the rule of law, such as the most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago, the next president should use every power at his disposal to restore order  and, if necessary, that includes sending in the National Guard or the troops, Mr. Trump said at a conservative conference in Dallas in August 2022, shortly before announcing that he was running to be that next president.",

Your foot is chained to a pipe and you have nothing apart from a hacksaw.Two men wake up in an abandoned industrial bathroom, each chained to a pipe. Once they find hacksaws in a toilet tank, they attempt to escape from their thick chains, to no avail.That is when a doctor played by Cary Elwes has a realization about their captor that brings the impossible choice of Saw into visceral focus: He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet.Saw, which was released 20 years ago this week, was never supposed to be a success. It was meant as a low-budget calling card for two Australian film students who were looking to start their careers with a scrappy splash and a neat idea: a serial killer who forces his victims to prove they want to stay alive through bloody sacrificial tasks.Instead, it made more than 80 times its budget at the box office, created a horror villain for the new millennium and inspired the label torture porn, with each installment in the ensuing franchise ratcheting up the disgust.It can be hard to remember two decades later that the original Saw was less interested in gore than morality.What would you do to save your life, or someone elses? said the actor Shawnee Smith, summing up the central tension behind the franchises elaborate traps. In order to expediently escape the reverse bear trap enclosing her head in Saw, Smiths character is forced to locate a key inside another persons stomach. He is drowsy but still alive.In Saw, Cary Elwess character verbalizes the tension and appeal of the franchise: He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. LionsgateElwes, known for playing Westley in The Princess Bride, said that Saw had appealed to him because it was a horror story embedded with ethical and moral questions.Its a thinking persons thriller, he said.The germ of the idea that became Saw was a simple one: two men, locked in a room, with a body lying between them. James Wan and Leigh Whannell, film school classmates at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, had been looking to develop their first feature and kicked around ideas until one stuck. They wrote the script together and Wan directed.Wan, who has gone on to make big-budget Hollywood fare as well as unhinged horror flicks, like Insidious and Malignant, said Saw turned classic tropes on their heads.Oh, youve seen that? Oh, you think you know whats going to happen? Wan said from a dingy basement bathroom in London, a fitting homage to Saw and the only place he could get cellphone service while shooting the next installment of The Conjuring franchise there. Im going to try something else you havent seen before.The classic tropes within Saw  serial killers, haunted detectives, creepy puppets  are mashed together and inverted around the undeniable binary of its core choice.Unlike the winking meta horror fare that preceded it, including horror buff Scream teens and Rube Goldberg machinations in Final Destination, no amount of genre knowledge can save the characters of Saw from having to make an ultimate decision.The film critic David Edelstein described Saw and some of its peers  most notably Eli Roths Hostel (2005)  as torture porn in a 2006 New York magazine essay. But the first Saw is not especially gruesome when compared with the deaths punctuating this years Terrifier 3 and In a Violent Nature.To escape the reverse bear trap enclosing her head, Shawnee Smiths character is forced to locate a key inside another persons stomach. LionsgateSaw is more of a detective thriller with a gruesome twist. The titular tool acts as a rusty Chekhovs gun, while the desperation of the characters provides the terror.The franchises traps are devised by the character John Kramer (Tobin Bell), a terminally ill cancer patient who is angry at people for wasting their lives. Kramer, who would eventually be known as Jigsaw, is technically not a serial killer. Every victim is given the choice to live.Deep down inside, although he is of course somewhat ruthless in this approach, Johns in the business of saving souls, Bell said.That framework came out of Whannells personal experience with recurring migraines in his early twenties. While sitting in a waiting room before a CT scan, he wondered how the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor could change someone.The game seemed to be about time, Whannell, who also plays the second man trapped in the bathroom, said of the killers motives. Hes giving them this time limit and hes making them do these extreme things, like, How badly do you want to live?Saw did not have a simple path to creation. When it came time to actually make the movie, Australian financing fell through.Wan and Whannell were ready to scrape together money to film on the cheap, but Whannells manager, Stacey Testro, thought it could work in Hollywood, where she also had an office. Instead of sending her to court producers in the United States with just a script, the writers made a 10-minute short film of the reverse bear trap sequence with Whannell in the rig.Testro remembers watching the short in her living room, with her luggage by the door and a car out front waiting to take her to the airport. It was just thrilling, she said.Producers at Evolution Entertainment  Gregg Hoffman, Oren Koules and Mark Burg  were impressed enough to give Wan and Whannell a $700,000 shooting budget for the chaotic 18-day shoot, which cut costs by filming mostly in the bathroom set. Wan, who had previously focused on stop-motion animation, also handmade Billy the Puppet, an unsettling ventriloquist dummy with red spiral cheeks, a tricycle and the franchises most famous line, I want to play a game.Wan used papier-mch, table tennis balls for Billys eyes and cardboard boxes to fill out a child-size tuxedo for the body. (At first he also had a bowler hat, Wan said, but it looked slightly too silly.)The limited budget did not prevent the movies ideas from resonating with audiences.The first movie was all about ethics and how far can you go and whats right and whats wrong with humanity, Burg said, recalling that Evolution thought Saw would be its version of David Finchers Se7en (1995).Saw was influenced by Se7en, in which Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are detectives chasing a serial killer who punishes his victims with elaborate setups. New Line CinemaWhannell described his goal for Saw as a mix between Se7en and Cube. In Finchers movie, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are detectives chasing down a serial killer who models his murders after the seven deadly sins, punishing his victims via elaborate setups symbolic of their moral failings. In Cube (1997), an offbeat Canadian science fiction horror film, prisoners in a mysterious jail travel through rooms rigged with traps.The extended Saw franchise  the 11th film is scheduled to come out next year  has not always stuck to the ideas put forward by the first movie. Wan never directed another Saw movie, while Whannell contributed to Saw II and wrote the screenplay for Saw III.In the decades since Saw was released, Wan has directed tentpole franchise entries like Aquaman (2018) and Furious 7 (2015). Whannell has also settled into the directors chair, including The Invisible Man (2020) starring Elisabeth Moss and the upcoming Wolf Man, both modern incarnations of classic horror stories.That success all goes back to the two friends as fledgling filmmakers trying to find a story that felt compelling, and then landing on ethical choices with bloody results.Whannell is proudest of the Saw franchises outsize impact on popular culture. His favorite: In The Sopranos, a character becomes fixated on pitching a movie that he describes as Saw meets The Godfather Part II. Billy the Puppet was recently added to the popular battle royale video game Fortnite.Whether we wanted to or not, Whannell said, we basically created the millennial Freddy Krueger.",

It was also one of only a handful of attacks by a foreign air force in Iran since its war with Iraq in the 1980s.Although it was a significant moment, Iran did not immediately set a time frame for a retaliation. The Iranian foreign ministry said that while Iran was obliged to defend itself, it was aware of its responsibilities for regional peace and security, avoiding the kind of bombastic language that characterized Irans initial responses to previous Israeli attacks.That eased fears that an uncontrollable conflict was about to break out, even if the prospect of such a clash has edged ever closer.",

Asked about her former advocacy for giving drivers licenses, college tuition and free health care to undocumented immigrants, she replied, Listen, that was five years ago. Those words hold a valuable lesson for a progressive movement more often heard quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s famous and rather different declaration that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.Dr. Kings line, originally from a 19th-century abolitionist and preacher named Theodore Parker, has become so embedded in modern American progressivism that President Barack Obama had it woven into an Oval Office rug. Justice, in this thinking, is not some ideologically neutral improvement of the human condition but rather a progressive notion of social justice, greater rights and autonomy and triumph over systemic forces of oppression. History has a right side, and it is the left side.Sure enough, the United States has steadily expanded rights and lifted marginalized groups  making good on what Dr. King called the promissory note of the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. American culture has steadily liberalized  tolerating, then accepting, then welcoming a broadening range of beliefs and identities. Thus the boundless confidence of young activists that whatever radical idea they pursue next will someday become conventional wisdom. Thus, too, the nervous and awkward following along by older progressives, who dare not risk a position that might seem reactionary.But what the moral universes long arc really has is survivorship bias. Progressive causes that achieved success and bettered the nation, like the New Deals worker protections and the civil rights movement of the 1960s, are highly visible today and taught in history books as important inflection points. But for every success, there are also many failures  bold ideas that proved not ahead of their time but simply foolish. Having flickered only briefly in the national consciousness, they are easily forgotten.",

Even Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, copied it.Four months and half a dozen proposed tax cuts later, Republican lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill, as well as some economists in touch with Mr. Trumps campaign, are taking a more circumspect approach. Asked whether they supported Mr. Trumps proposals, a typical response was: Lets see after the election.Ill decide what my position is on it once we see what the whole picture is next year, Senator Michael D. Crapo, an Idaho Republican who could lead the chambers tax-writing committee if his party regains control of the Senate, said last month.The caution is a sign that Mr. Trumps ideas may be too expensive and outlandish for Republicans in Congress to embrace. The rest of the party had been focused on extending the 2017 tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law. Some of Mr. Trumps recent proposals undercut changes that were made as part of that tax package.",

On the other side was a call to action: You have the courage and the conviction to vote for Randall Terry.But the mailer did not come from supporters of Mr. Terry, a third-party presidential candidate and longtime leader in the anti-abortion movement.Rather, the fine print showed it was the work of a nascent super PAC with the anodyne name of Civic Truth Action that was funded by millions of dollars in difficult-to-trace money linked to Democrats trying to elect Vice President Kamala Harris as the next president.The final days of a high-stakes election are often a time of political mischief. The message pushed by Civic Truth Action  purportedly to help Mr. Terry but aimed at siphoning votes from former President Donald J. Trump  may be among the most cynical. But it is far from unique. Across the country, supporters of Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump are taking advantage of a patchwork of lax laws that allow partisans to funnel millions of dollars through daisy chains of opaque entities into hard-hitting campaign tactics, all to try to sway the tiny slice of swing-state voters who could make the difference.",

In 2000, it took more than a month to determine a winner because of a closely fought race that came down to a recount in Florida, which also involved disputed ballots. In 2020, it took four days to determine that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had defeated the incumbent, President Donald J. Trump. A surge in mail-in voting and closely fought races in several swing states has meant that more votes must be counted before experts can call the race.This election may play out similarly to 2020 because:There is more mail voting and early voting compared with elections before 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic in the 2020 election upended voting patterns for many Americans. So far this year, there are signs that those changes have persisted, with more people voting early and by mail than in previous elections.Most state legislatures prevent counting ballots before Election Day  or even preparing to count them. In Pennsylvania, many voters submit their ballots by mail, but state law prevents election officials from taking steps like verifying signatures and opening envelopes before Election Day. In 2020, it took Pennsylvania four days to determine that Mr. Biden had won the state.Polling also indicates this could be one of the closest elections in history, with the candidates effectively tied across the key battlegrounds. The final result could come down to a few thousand votes in a few swing states, meaning it could be difficult to call the winner in some states before nearly all votes are counted.There are other quirks too. For example, the ballots in Maricopa County, Arizonas most populous region, are spread across two pages this year, requiring election officials to process roughly twice as many pieces of paper compared with 2020. Election officials there said it could take 10 to 13 days to count all the ballots.",

Ask her a question to which she doesnt have a canned answer and she struggles for a coherent response. The most notable difference between her current presidential bid and her previous one in 2019 is that she has repudiated many of her past views. Is it because shes hiding her real convictions  or because she has few real convictions at all?Yet Im going to vote for her. Other conservatives should, too.Why? Because Donald Trump is worse. He isnt worse because hes a fascist: If he were, his outspoken opponents would have wound up in prison, not on MSNBC. He isnt worse because his presidency was an unremitting failure: The (prepandemic) economy thrived, Operation Warp Speed was a triumph, the world was more at peace than it is today and there were important diplomatic achievements such as the Abraham Accords. Nor is he the only one who can disrespect political norms: Its Harris, not Trump, who is campaigning on ending the Senate filibuster and perhaps packing the Supreme Court.But Trump is worse in ways that matter profoundly to the rule of law, the health of capitalism and the future of freedom at home and abroad. Conservatives who claim to care about these things should also care about what Trump may do to each of them  and, crucially, do so in the name of conservatism. Consider:Law. Conservatives are indignant about the flimsy civil and criminal cases progressive prosecutors have brought against Trump  cases they almost certainly wouldnt have brought against anyone else.But politicizing justice is exactly what Trump sought to do during his presidency. He tried to strong-arm Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, into participating in a dirt-digging expedition against Joe and Hunter Biden. His Justice Department tried to block a merger between AT&T and Time Warner in 2017, almost certainly out of presidential spite against CNN. He appointed a hack as an acting attorney general and took legal advice from conspiracy theorists, including Sidney Powell.",

CNN (where I am an on-air contributor) also had the race tied at 47 to 47 among likely voters. CBS News polling shows the contest effectively even, favoring Ms. Harris 50 to 49 among likely voters. (An exception to the pattern, polling by ABC News was a bit more bullish on Ms. Harris, at 51 to 47 among likely voters.)And yet these polls actually dont tell the same story. Though several of them show a dead heat, beneath the surface, they diverge in how they arrive at that result.Lets take two possible theories for how this election might unfold. The first theory, which Ill call the realignment, is that political divides like race and economic class are being replaced by divides like gender and education level. As the Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria writes: We are seeing a realignment in which the old categories of economic status and race are giving way to new categories such as social status and cultural divides around gender.

            "text": "NEW YORK  Anthony Volpes jersey was caked in dirt as he fielded grounders at shortstop before the ninth inning of Game 4 of the World Series. The New York Yankees were on the brink of a victory that would keep their season alive.Then, the most exhilarating moment of Volpes life unfolded.Like many kids who grew up playing baseball in the New York area, Volpe dreamed of becoming the Yankees shortstop and a franchise icon like his hero, Derek Jeter. While the odds of such a dream coming true are nearly impossible, Volpe now lives it every day.AdvertisementHis deep-rooted Yankees fandom spans generations. His great-grandfather immigrated from Italy and made a living selling fruit from a pushcart in downtown Manhattan. He later fought in World War II and returned home with shrapnel wounds. Volpes grandfather was just 4 years old when his father went to war, and upon his return, they bonded over Yankees games on the radio. Every night, trying to make up for lost time, the two would share stories of life and baseball.Growing up, Volpe wore No. 7 in honor of his grandfathers idol, Mickey Mantle. So Tuesday night embodied a dream fulfilled for Volpe and his ancestors. He launched a go-ahead grand slam in the third inning, giving the Yankees a 5-2 lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also stole two bases, becoming the first Yankee to hit a grand slam and steal multiple bases in a game  regular season or postseason  since none other than Mantle.But the moment that stood out the most came with the Yankees leading 11-4 in the ninth inning. Nearly 50,000 fans at Yankee Stadium erupted and began chanting Vol-pe! Vol-pe! Vol-pe! He turned toward the Bleacher Creatures and saluted them, striving to maintain his composure. Deep down, the 23-year-old was experiencing the pinnacle of his lifes journey.Number one, Volpe exclaimed with pure joy. Definitely number one.Yankee Stadium hadnt erupted like it did Tuesday in 15 years, not since Game 6 of the 2009 World Series. Shortly after that victory, an 8-year-old Volpe watched the championship parade with his family, dreaming of one day parading down the Canyon of Heroes as fans chanted his name the same way he did for Jeter.Fifteen years later, on the set of Foxs postgame show, Jeter playfully ribbed Volpe, suggesting he should have been in school instead of at the parade.AdvertisementBut with the Yankees down 3-1 in the World Series and history against them, Volpe admitted he hadnt fully grasped the significance of Tuesday night.Hopefully, when we win the World Series and Im with my family, we can reflect on everything, Volpe said. It was just a big game. We wanted to go 1-0 today and see where it takes us.Volpe envisioned nights like Tuesday probably every night as a child. He doesnt take for granted that this dream was shared by his friends, his cousins, and his sister, Olivia. But winning the World Series always loomed as his top aspiration.Anthony Volpe could only dream of nights like Tuesday, only this time, he made it a reality. (Sarah Stier / Getty Images)Nothing else compares, Volpe said. So theres still a lot of work to do.Austin Wells, Volpes best friend on the team, felt the ground shake when Volpe hit his grand slam. The two had often discussed what this moment would feel like if they reached this stage together.Wells spent countless nights at Volpes childhood home, poring over old Yankees footage and imagining the electric atmosphere of an October crowd at Yankee Stadium. On Tuesday, he experienced it, hitting a solo home run into the second deck to extend the Yankees lead to 6-4. Earlier, he smacked a double with Volpe on second base; although Volpes base-running blunder may have cost the Yankees an additional run, it ultimately didnt matter as the offense finally broke through against the Dodgers bullpen.Los Angeles opted not to use its high-leverage relievers, believing it will certainly win one of the next three games, rendering a Game 4 loss moot. However, the Yankees faced a must-win scenario. If the Yankees mount a comeback, it will surely deserve its own Netflix documentary, like the Red Sox one on the streaming platform now, and the offensive explosion led by Volpes grand slam in Game 4 should be its starting point.We were down 2-0, but we still said, Hey, this aint gonna be easy, but this is what were made for,' Jazz Chisholm Jr. said. Who doesnt want to make history? I love making history. I love writing my name in the history books.After Game 4, Volpe spent a few moments with the Fox postgame crew, where David Ortiz, well-acquainted with comebacks from 3-0 deficits, gifted Volpe a shirt featuring Big Papi in a Red Sox jersey with the caption, My Dawg! Volpe chuckled, insisting he wouldnt ever wear it, knowing it would be sacrilegious to don Boston gear.AdvertisementYet, even more meaningful than the shirt were Jeters words on set. In the same way he idolized Jeter, countless New York kids now aspire to be like Volpe, dreaming of one day hitting a grand slam in the World Series at Yankee Stadium as the franchises shortstop.And perhaps, if theyre lucky, theyll one day recount how that grand slam led to baseball immortality.(Top photo: Sarah Stier / Getty Images)",

Trump could go further to effectively ban abortion nationwide  and abortion opponents have given him the road map.It is hard to know what on the anti-abortion agenda Mr. Trump would support. He has shifted his public views on abortion so often that its hard to say what he believes or wants to do. He has said he wants to leave it to the states. More recently, he said he would not sign a federal abortion ban, and would veto one if a Republican-controlled Congress sent it to his desk. He has publicly supported I.V.F., which some anti-abortion groups oppose.But Mr. Trump would also be under pressure from the anti-abortion groups that have ardently supported him to take other actions that would go much further than the 15-week national bans that congressional Republicans have proposed since Roe was overturned. These include reversing federal guidance that says even states with bans must allow doctors to provide abortion in cases of medical emergency; using administrative agencies to ban abortion pills; and using his executive powers to achieve the anti-abortion movements ultimate goal: recognizing fetal personhood in the Constitution.",

            "text": "NEW YORK  The hometown kid came to the rescue on Tuesday, saving the New York Yankees from elimination in the World Series.Anthony Volpe, the New York-born shortstop who attended the Yankees last championship parade in 2009 as an 8-year-old, belted a go-ahead grand slam in the third inning of Game 4, powering the Yankees to a 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Bronx.AdvertisementThe Yankees  who got four critical outs from Luke Weaver  became the first team since 1970 to force a Game 5 after losing the first three games of the World Series. The last nine teams facing that deficit had been eliminated in Game 4.Freddie Freeman set a record in defeat, becoming the first player to hit homers in six consecutive World Series games, a streak that began with Atlanta in 2021. Freeman lined a two-run bullet to right in the first inning for the second game in a row, but the Dodgers failed in their effort to clinch the title with a bullpen game.Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers never got much going and the Yankees pulled away with a late offensive explosion. (Elsa / Getty Images)Analyzing the bullpen decisionsHeres the thing with how the Dodgers approached their bullpen game, particularly the third inning: Its largely in line with what worked for them in the National League Championship Series against the Mets when they ran this same playbook twice. The Dodgers got about what they expected out of Ben Casparius. They knew they would need multiple innings out of Landon Knack. Even though everyone was available for the Dodgers, using some of their top arms would have changed the calculus of how they approached a potential Game 5.Having Daniel Hudson take on the heart of the Yankees order brought understandable risk. His production faded over the season, largely because of his propensity for allowing the long ball. It was Volpe  not Juan Soto, Aaron Judge nor even Giancarlo Stanton  who took him out of the ballpark, but there were going be stretches in Game 4 when the Dodgers had to grit their teeth. Hudson clearly didnt have his command despite striking out the scariest matchup in Soto.Knack, warming up as the inning built, was a long-term play. Using another righty for Volpe with the bases loaded wouldve burned another arm for a pocket of left-handed hitters, and using one of their two lefties would have set up a less-than-ideal platoon spot. Using a leverage arm would have ramifications for a potential Game 5 and beyond.AdvertisementSo Hudson faced Volpe. He hung a slider. Volpe had struggled this postseason but did not miss his chance.Yankees provide a formula for a historic comebackThe Yankees had not gotten much production from the bottom of the order in the first three games of the World Series. Entering Game 4, the Yankees 7-8-9 batters had a combined four hits. On Tuesday, they combined for four hits through the first six innings.Volpe delivered that critical grand slam in the third inning, giving the Yankees a 5-2 lead. It was Volpes first home run since Sept. 21 and a reminder that he has power when he connects on a pitch. Volpe abandoned the power approach he showcased in his rookie season so he could increase his contact in Year 2. That decision backfired as he was a worse overall hitter. But for one night, Volpe turned back the clock and became the power-hitting shortstop the Yankees thought he would become.Austin Wells, who has struggled mightily over the past two months, smoked two batted balls. In the second inning, he hit a 406-foot double to center field that would have been gone in 17 ballparks. Wells then hit the ball over the fence in the sixth inning to give the Yankees a 6-4 lead.If the Yankees were to mount a historic comeback in this series, part of the formula is getting production up and down their lineup like they did in Game 4.Dodgers havent maximized their extra looks at the Yankees bullpenFor as much as the Dodgers have seen the Yankees bullpen, they have yet to accomplish what they usually do: take advantage of multiple looks, adjust and find the soft spots to break through. The Dodgers again chased a Yankee starter before he could complete the fifth inning, as Aaron Boone removed Luis Gil before the pitcher faced Shohei Ohtani a third time through the order. Ohtani immediately laced a single off Tim Hill and the Dodgers got two runs in the inning, but New Yorks bullpen wound up going the final five innings allowing zero runs.AdvertisementThrough four games this series, the Dodgers have managed 12 runs off Yankees starters in 16 innings. In 19 2/3 innings against the Yankees bullpen, theyve scored six  and just one since their furious comeback in Game 1. The prevailing theory is that seeing more out of a bunch of relievers should favor the hitters, particularly with fatigue setting in within a series. Its gone the wrong direction on the Dodgers hitters, which kept Games 2 and 3 from being bigger routs and impeded the Dodgers ability to come back in Game 4.Bullpen, Luke Weaver save the dayCloser Luke Weaver pulled off an incredible feat, tearing through the heart of the Dodgers order for four outs, and the rest of the relievers picked up starting pitcher Gil, who lasted just four innings.Weaver entered with two outs and a runner on second base in the seventh with the Yankees ahead 6-4. He immediately struck out Mookie Betts with a runner on second base. In the eighth inning, Weaver continued to dominate, retiring the side by getting Freeman to pop out and striking out Teoscar Hernndez and Max Muncy.Hill (2/3 innings), Clay Holmes (1 1/3 innings) and Mark Leiter Jr. (2/3 innings) combined to be the bridge to Weaver.In the ninth  with a seven-run lead thanks to a five-run eighth-inning rally  Tim Mayza finished things off with a 1-2-3 ninth.The Yankees will undoubtedly go into Wednesday with a tired bullpen. But facing elimination, all bets are off regarding whether Boone will rest anyone. If the Yankees can prevail, they will have Thursdays off day to recover before Game 6 on Friday in Los Angeles. Fortunately for them, they will start ace Gerrit Cole, who has been a workhorse throughout his career but hasnt topped 89 pitches in any of his four starts this postseason.(Top photo of Anthony Volpe: Elsa / Getty Images)",

When Betts snagged the ball with his glove above the padded wall, Capobianco gripped Betts glove with both hands, opened it, reached inside with his right hand and knocked the ball back onto the field. The umpires ruled the play fan interference and Torres was out.Capobiancos brother, Darren, 29, said he saw Betts glove go over the concrete wall as he tried to make a catch on Torres hit.I just see the ball kind of  I dont want to say (go) up for grabs, if that makes sense, Darren Capobianco said. And then Mookie was swearing at us. Not good.After the game, Betts said that his wrist felt perfectly fine, and he brushed off questions about the incident, which he called irrelevant because the Dodgers lost.It doesnt matter, Betts said, when asked if hed ever seen fans act so aggressively. We lost, its irrelevant, Im fine, hes fine, everythings cool. We lost the game, thats what Im kind of focused on, turn the page. Everythings fine.Austin Capobianco is a Yankee Stadium season-ticket holder, his brother said.Immediately, security guards walked over to Austin Capobianco, who tried to argue with them that Betts glove had reached into foul territory, according to a video obtained by The Athletic. Ana Flamengo, a Yankees fan from Connecticut, said she was standing on the concourse when stadium security escorted Austin Capobianco from the stands.AdvertisementI saw him being walked out, Flamengo said. I told him he was my hero for trying to save the Yankees. Its the championship game.A league spokesperson confirmed that two fans were ejected.That was one of the most aggressive fan ripping the ball out of his glove (incidents) that Ive ever seen, longtime former MLB umpire Dale Scott said.Dodgers pitcher Ben Casparius, who was on the mound at the time, was simply glad that umps called the batter out. Never seen anything like that, he said. It was interesting, especially I think it being the second or third pitch of the game, an interesting start to the game for sure.The Dodgers Tommy Edman didnt care for how the interaction played out.That looked ridiculous from my perspective, Edman said.The guy was trying to yank (Betts) glove off, pulling at his wrist, looked like he got ejected, and Im glad he did. Ive never seen anything like that. That was unacceptable.The Athletics Evan Drellich, Rustin Dodd and Sam Blum contributed to this story.Required reading(Photo: Robert Deutsch / Imagn Images)",

            "text": "As the contest for the White House draws to a close, I asked a wide range of scholars and political strategists where they think the blame will go, whether it is Kamala Harris or Donald Trump who wins.Their answers varied widely.William Galston is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Harris, he wrote in an email,has run a surprisingly centrist presidential campaign while the partys progressive wing has bitten its tongue. If she wins, the gloves will come off, and progressives will probably repeat what they did during the first two years of the Biden administration  pressure the new president to support their agenda.But, Galston noted, even if Harris wins,Republicans are likely to take control of the Senate. If so, Harris would be forced to negotiate with a Senate Republican leadership to get anything done, reducing the influence of the left on her administration, and House Democrats would face a choice between gridlock and accepting whatever the administration could get from a Republican-led Senate.How would Harris exercise presidential executive authority?Galston:The answer to this question depends on who she really is  a former progressive mugged by reality and transformed into a Biden Democrat, or an actual progressive who is trimming her sails to close the deal with moderate voters. If its the latter, expect the rule-making process to tilt left, especially on cultural issues. If its the former, the Harris administration will disappoint the left on immigration, crime and education, among other issues.Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, also replied to my queries by email:If Harris wins it will be because she successfully jettisoned the progressive dogma that doomed Democratic primary candidates in the 2020 cycle and made a convincing case to mainstream voters that she is a Democratic centrist. Her decisive move to the center began on the day Joe Biden stepped back from the race and culminated in her convention speech, which was the most centrist of any Democratic nominee in memory, including Bill Clinton in 1992.Harriss embrace, Kessler continued, ofopportunity economics and capitalism helped her close the economy gap with Donald Trump. Her tough on the border policies have closed some of the border gap with Trump. Her accountability and prevention framing and touting her personal gun ownership has helped her on crime. All of these are tier one issues for voters and issues in which Democrats suffered huge deficits.What if Trump wins?Kessler:If Harris loses, progressives will argue publicly that her moving to the center was the cause. Frankly, I dont think even they will believe it. If you watch the swing state ads against Harris or congressional Democrats like Sherrod Brown, they are devastating frontal assaults on progressive liturgy. Every ad is about chaos at the border, out-of-control city streets, runaway inflation and mischaracterizations on transgender issues.How will Republicans react to a Trump defeat?Lets be realistic, Kessler wrote:There are only two outcomes in the minds of the Trump people  he wins or it was stolen from him. What happens to Republicans after a Trump loss will depend on whether enough Republicans tell Trump that they have lost patience with his stolen election charade. If youre counting on courage from congressional Republicans, dont bet the house on it.Ruy Teixeira, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a co-author of The Emerging Democratic Majority, contended that even before the votes have been counted, the progressive movement in the Democratic Party is dead in its tracks. His views of the cultural left are unrelentingly hostile.",

            "text": "NEW YORK  One more day of summer. For every team faced with an early demise in the World Series, thats the vision: one more day of summer to play with your friends. Youll have to face the winter soon enough.So on Tuesday afternoon, under steel-gray skies in the steel-gray fortress of Yankee Stadium, Anthony Rizzo gave voice to what all of his teammates were thinking.AdvertisementToday could be our last drive to the ballpark, said Rizzo, the veteran first baseman. Today could be the last time this teams ever together.The everyday rhythms are part of baseballs charm, the routine a source of comfort in a game so capricious. The New York Yankees did not think they had played very badly in this World Series, yet theyd lost the first three games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. No team in the last half-century had faced that deficit and won another game.We were down 2-0 and we said, Hey, this ss not gonna be easy, but this is what were made for, third baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. said. We lost Game 3 and we said, Hey, who doesnt want to make history? I know I love making history. I love writing my name in the history books and being a part of it. So lets do it.After thumping the Dodgers, 11-4, these Yankees have lots of chiseling to do before carving their place in history as the only team to win the World Series after losing the first three games.But what you heard in their clubhouse after Game 4 was the sound of hope, of a plausible scenario for a singular achievement. On Wednesday, Rizzo noted, the Yankees will face Jack Flaherty and the Dodgers cast of high-leverage relievers. Theyve seen them all before, and theyll be ready.The flight to L.A. will be really special if we make that happen, Rizzo said.Eight years ago with the Chicago Cubs, Rizzo played another Game 5 on Halloween eve, needing a win to extend the World Series. The Cubs trusted an ace starter, Jon Lester, and a well-rested closer, Aroldis Chapman, for a win that clinched a final road trip for a tight group. The Cubs would return from Cleveland as champions.Now the Yankees can use their top starter, Gerrit Cole, to start Game 5, with relief ace Luke Weaver relatively fresh after throwing only 21 pitches Tuesday. The Yankees five-run rally in the eighth padded their lead and saved Weaver from working another inning.Gleyber Torres three-run homer was the big blow then, but the preceding at-bat had the Yankees buzzing. With one out and runners at second and third, Alex Verdugo wore down Brent Honeywell Jr. for 11 pitches. His bouncer to second scored Anthony Volpe and set up the blast that followed.I know he probably didnt put up the numbers in the regular season that he wanted to, Aaron Judge, who was 1 for 3, said of Verdugo. But all year long he just said: Get me to the postseason and Ill do something special. And thats what weve seen so far this whole postseason.Verdugo hasnt actually been Reggie Jackson; hes hitting .200/.280/.311 in October, even worse than his regular season numbers (.233/.291/.356). But his one home run this month came with two on and two outs in the ninth inning of Game 3  a jolt of confidence for a slumbering offense.AdvertisementThe Dodgers started Game 4 just as they had the night before, with a two-run homer by Freddie Freeman in the top of the first. But while it was the same kind of hit, this one packed less punch. The Yankees were too awestruck to be discouraged.My first thought is: this guy is superhuman, Weaver said. Youre sitting there kind of marveling at what hes doing. So youve got to give him all the respect and appreciation for what hes doing on the biggest stage. But, I mean, youre looking at it and its early, right? Youre not like, Oh, its a repeat.It was an all-new episode with a mostly fresh cast of Dodgers pitchers. Three of them were new to this World Series and covered seven innings. The pitcher the Yankees had seen already, Daniel Hudson, allowed Volpes go-ahead grand slam in the third.It really just takes one big swing, and I feel like that was Volpes big swing there, said catcher Austin Wells, who doubled and homered like Volpe. It allowed everyone to just take a deep breath and have fun. I think also the situation we were in, we just kind of needed to say screw it and go after it and have fun because some guys may never come back to the World Series again.Volpe sure had fun; by the end, his muddy uniform was so brown that youd think he played for the San Diego Padres. He lived the fantasy of every New York-born kid of his generation: a shortstop in pinstripes, starring in the World Series. He could get used to this extra month of work.Its my first playoffs, but these have been probably the craziest things Ive ever been a part of, Volpe said. So its just foot on the gas, always.The Yankees stalled for three games. Now the engine is purring. Theyre still tracing a narrow path on the edge of a cliff, trying to do what no team has ever done: not just winning the World Series after losing the first three games, but simply forcing a Game 6.AdvertisementMaybe theyll make history. Maybe  probably  they wont. But theyre still playing, and thats the best they can do for now.I feel like today is a reminder to show you why were in the World Series, why we got this far, Chisholm said, and why we dont expect to be done.(Top photo of the Yankees bench celebrating Gleyber Torres home run in Game 4: Elsa / Getty Images)",

This was a defining moment for a certain up-and-coming military contractor that had built key parts of this new system: Elon Musks SpaceX.SpaceX over the last year started to move in a big way into the business of building military and spy satellites, an industry that has long been dominated by major contractors like Raytheon and Northrop Grumman as well as smaller players like York Space Systems.This shift comes as the Pentagon and U.S. spy agencies are preparing to spend billions of dollars to build a series of new constellations of low-earth-orbit satellites, much of it in response to recent moves by China to build its own space-based military systems.",

His music is poetic, emotionally direct even in its stranger moments and suggestive of deep vulnerability: a unique and potent combination. On the concert stage, where everything becomes more highly charged, it can be overwhelming.Earlier this month, I played his piano concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. I came offstage feeling altered, as I so often do after performing Schumanns music  as if I had seen his innermost self and, in the process, accessed my own. Moments later, in the green room, I heard the questions Ive grown accustomed to but still steel myself against: Had Schumann already gone mad when he wrote this work? Can I hear the madness in the music?Schumann did indeed suffer from severe mental illness; he was institutionalized for the last years of his life. And there is no denying that as his condition worsened, the character of his music changed: It turned inward and grew increasingly static, still conveying his essence but somehow more aloof from the listener. And yet these questions always bother me. They reduce this beautiful, complicated, staggeringly gifted person to a pathology.More dangerously, they indicate a persistent and pernicious stereotype: the tortured artist. Think of the popular conception of the raging Beethoven, the anguished van Gogh, the volatile Caravaggio, the idiosyncratic Vladimir Horowitz, the guitar-smashing rock star.",

And this election coincides with one of the greatest scientific turning points in human history: the birth of artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., which is likely to emerge in the next four years and will require our next president to pull together a global coalition to productively, safely and compatibly govern computers that will soon have minds of their own superior to our own.Donald Trump  who neglected to even appoint a science adviser until over 18 months into his presidency  is intellectually and temperamentally unsuited to assemble any such global alliance. His administration hastened a vaccine for Covid-19 with one hand and then fostered doubt about using it with the other when it met with a conservative anti-vaccine backlash.Today, Trumps first priority is not capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities that will come from America leading in the use of A.G.I. nor building a global coalition to govern it, but to impose higher tariffs on our allies to block their exports of cars and toys and other goods to the United States. The only technology Trump seems to be deeply interested in is Truth Social, his own version of X. Indeed, since Trump has described himself as a very stable genius, he probably doubts that there could even be an artificial intelligence greater than his own.Kamala Harris, given her background in law enforcement, connections to Silicon Valley and the work she has already done on A.I. in the past four years, is up to this challenge, which is a key reason she has my endorsement for the presidency.",

The order, which did not include a vote count, gave no reasoning and was unsigned, as is typical in cases decided on the emergency docket. But it noted that Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the states request to continue the voter purge.The case is among a handful of election-related disputes to reach the Supreme Court in the final days before the election. On Tuesday, the justices batted away a bid by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped his independent campaign for the White House in August, to remove his name from the ballots in two crucial battleground states, Michigan and Wisconsin.The voter dispute in Virginia arose in the months before the election, when Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, signed an executive order to hasten the removal of suspected noncitizens from the states voter rolls. In fact, studies show that noncitizens voting is extremely rare, though Republicans, including former President Donald J. Trump and his allies, have continued to deploy the claim.",

Winners are most likely to be called in Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina, but in the other four it may take some time, especially if the margins are close. In fact, thanks to a combination of new state laws and the inaction of legislators who could have made vote-counting more efficient  but didnt  it may take even longer to declare a winner than it did in 2020, when news organizations called the race four days after Election Day.A long lag between Election Day and the announcement of a winner would test the country. In 2020, misinformation and conspiracy theories flourished as vote counting dragged on in a handful of key battleground states. So for this Election Day it is critical that people know what to expect, the true nature of the likely delays and how some of them might have been prevented.Since 2020, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have either added rules that could slow down their vote counts, or allowed existing rules that contributed to long tabulating times in 2020 to remain in place. Only Michigan and North Carolina have meaningfully changed their laws to speed up the process. (Fortunately, Georgia historically counts quickly; Trump-aligned members of the state election board recently tried to impose rules that would have slowed the process down, but Georgias courts rejected the attempt.)The result is a patchwork of new developments and old laws  a few of which are encouraging, but many of which are troubling.

With millions watching, he would march into the final week of the contest as a conquering champion, so popular he could fill an arena in deep-blue New York twice over.Having energized his most fervent supporters, he would send them out to do whatever it took to return him to the White House. That was the idea, at least. But what works in theory does not always deliver in practice, and in practice, Trumps climactic rally at Madison Square Garden was nothing short of a disaster.Did Trump have the crowds he wanted? Yes. But that was the extent of his success that night. His overall message was dark, disturbing and as autocratic as you might expect from a man whose top officials have been warning us about his fascistic tendencies. Were running against a massive, crooked, malicious leftist machine thats running the Democrat Party, Trump said. They are smart and vicious, they are the enemy within, we must defeat them.Overshadowing the crude authoritarianism of Trumps remarks, however, were those of nearly every other speaker at the podium, who illustrated  each in his own way  the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the MAGA movement. There was, of course, the comedian from Texas who let loose a string of offensive jokes aimed at Blacks and Latinos, relishing the permissive atmosphere. Unfortunately for Trump, one of those jokes was an anti-Puerto Rican remark so racist that it galvanized some of the most prominent figures in Puerto Rican cultural life (This is what they think of us, Ricky Martin wrote in Spanish to his millions of followers on Instagram) and may have jeopardized the campaigns standing in Pennsylvania, where hundreds of thousands of Hispanic Americans of Puerto Rican descent live.",

This staple of horror movies, when done well, is instantly memorable. With Times film writers, filmmakers and stars weighing in, we ranked the 25 jump scares that still get us every time. WARNINGThis article contains spoilers and may include intense scenes that could be disturbing for some readers.David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker on the Buildup in Seven When a rotting figure gasps for breath, the reaction of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and John C. McGinley was so convincing, it spawned a modern myth: that they werent told the body was an actor, not a prop. As it turns out, the stars did know (sorry, internet!), but the fact that the myth persists is a testament to the potency of the scene. In an email, the director, David Fincher, credited the screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker: Andy wrote it  it was a great idea  so I filmed it. The police pull back a grimy sheet to reveal a decomposing body ... ... Brad Pitts detective isnt so sure what hes seeing ... ... and when John C. McGinleys SWAT leader leans over the body, they all get a shock. But in an interview, Walker insisted it was Fincher and the prosthetics and makeup master, Rob Bottin, who turned his vision into a grisly jump scare, one that shouldnt have worked because it was absolutely expected. It was so much more a build, an exciting and almost clichd action scene that kind of slowly turns, Walker said. Their goal was to take the audiences expectation of the cavalry riding in, then to get a buzz saw to the face.

A gravelly voice uttering the dreaded Babadook, dook, dook. And Amelia, a mother whos mentally unraveling, trembling under a blanket. In The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent, the soundscape is both classic haunted house and modern nightmare. The scene was intended to mimic what anyone would feel lying in bed as footsteps approach. All the sound is sucked out of the moment, Kent said in an interview. Its like we become hyper-aware. I hoped to draw the audience in and have them become her. Kent didnt follow tradition and incorporate most sound in postproduction. What I tend to do is make sure that the sound is in there, enough temporary sound is in there to make sure all this visual stuff works, she explained. So its very important to rhythm. Cutting a film is much closer to music than many people probably realize.

He also grew up to write the novel Psycho, the source for the movie with a jump scare so effective it transformed, for many, the experience of taking a shower. Jump scares are considered the fart jokes of horror: cheap, easy and lowbrow. But that gives short shrift to a long, potent legacy. Of course, they can be crude, overdone and shoehorned in, but they can also be refined, mysterious and emotionally integrated. And as Chaney demonstrated a century ago, even the simplest ones have a power that should not be underestimated. The stakes are high because success is binary: A jump scare produces a jolt or it doesnt work. That puts a premium on novelty. You cant just place another figure in a rotating mirror and expect shudders. Its been done too many times. To really unsettle, you must subvert expectations, add misdirection, a wilder image, perhaps a disorienting sound cue. More ingenuity goes into certain jump scares than entire movies. Far from simple to pull off, a truly great one is a feat of pure cinema. Jump scares have an advantage online, where context shifts rapidly. They can not only work independently of the movie, but also sometimes find a more popular second life outside it. In recent years, a canon has emerged, picked apart and debated by fans yet inspiring to filmmakers. In a genre more crowded than ever, where every kind of abrupt shift of camera angle, music cue or creepy image seems to have been employed to find a new way to shock, jump scares have become increasingly elaborate. At their best, they are ambitious set pieces, operating like showstoppers in musicals. The director James Wan is a contemporary master of the art, and one of his most bravura examples is from The Conjuring (2013), a haunted house movie in which Lili Taylor is terrorized by a clapping sound in the cellar. Patiently established over several scenes, this ingeniously startling fright involves no special effects or monsters. Theres a bouncing ball, two hands and the oldest scare of all: fear of the dark. The result doesnt just judder nerves. Like the most thrilling art, it rattles you into seeing old things anew while reordering your sense of the possible.",

The list of Ukrainian cities and towns largely leveled to the ground by Russian bombs and artillery grows with each passing month.Russian forces have moved forward in small increments, sustaining a staggering number of casualties to take cities like Avdiivka, which Moscow captured in February. They are now closing in on the nearby city of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian stronghold in the east.In recent months, the fighting has spread to the Russian-Ukrainian border area. In early May, Russian forces launched an offensive in Ukraines northeast, seizing several settlements in a push near the city of Kharkiv. In August, the Ukrainian Army crossed into Russias western Kursk region in a surprise assault that brought the war into the Russian territory in a way never before seen, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to evacuate.Away from the front, millions of Ukrainians have spent hours in bomb shelters as Russia rains down missiles and drones on military units and civilians across the nation. Ukraines energy grid, severely damaged, is working but sporadically. Thousands of schools, hospitals and cultural institutions have been damaged or destroyed. Millions have lost their homes.For all that time, photographers with The New York Times and other news organizations have chronicled the war, capturing a slice of how soldiers and civilians have experienced it.

Abdur-Rahim was 43.The school said in a statement that complications arose during his treatment at a Tampa-area hospital.All of us with South Florida Athletics are grieving with the loved ones of Coach Abdur-Rahim, athletic director Michael Kelly said in a statement. He was authentic, driven, and his infectious personality captivated all of Bulls Nation. Coach Abdur-Rahim leaves a lasting impact on our student-athletes, the University, and the community.AdvertisementAbdur-Rahim was seen as a rising star in the profession and a potential major program coach. He led a remarkable turnaround in his first season with the Bulls last year, earning unanimous American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year honors. He coached South Florida to a school-record 25 victories, its first regular-season conference title ever, its first appearance in the polls and its first NIT appearance in more than a decade.Before taking over the Bulls in March 2023, Abdur-Rahim, a Georgia native, guided Kennesaw State to 26 wins and its first trip to the NCAA Tournament after the program went 1-28 in his first season at the helm (2019-20).The Southeastern Louisiana graduate also spent time as an assistant at Georgia and Texas A&M.In a very short time, Coach Abdur-Rahim made an indelible impact on the University of South Florida, school president Rhea Law said. Throughout my time working with Coach Abdur-Rahim, I was continually inspired by his leadership, and truly admired his sincere approach to connecting with our entire student body. His influence on our student-athletes, coaching staff and the university community will live on forever.Corey Staniscia witnessed Abdur-Rahims influence and sincere connections firsthand as the director of the Bulls Fowler Ave Collective. Abdur-Rahim sent random supportive text messages. More than once, he hung around the campus Starbucks and put students drinks on his tab.The last time Staniscia saw him, he asked how the team was jelling. Abdur-Rahims answer: Im getting them to love each other.That man loved his athletes and what he did, Staniscia said. He truly did care about them.We couldnt have asked for a better person to be here.Abdur-Rahim is survived by his wife, Arianne Buchanan, and three children, Laila, Lana and Aydin. His older brother, Shareef, was a longtime forward in the NBA.Abdur-Rahims death comes less than a week before South Floridas scheduled exhibition against Edward Waters. The school did not announce an interim coach.(Photo: Chris Jones / Imagn Images)",

The disease, which has a prognosis worse than that of most cancers, afflicts more than 3 percent of people ages 65 and older. It is expected to become more common as people live longer.Replacing peoples heart valves, even if they were not yet experiencing any ill effects, appeared to roughly halve their risk of being unexpectedly hospitalized for heart problems over at least two years, the trial found.",

There was just an explosion, a resident said, and then a pile of smoldering rubble where a small shopping center once stood.Local officials say the device used in that attack on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia last month was a Russian glide bomb  the first indication, they say, that Russia would begin targeting their city with the powerful weapon.Since then, local officials say, glide bombs have frequently struck the city, wounding more than 100 people and killing at least two. They are considered especially dangerous because they are hard to intercept.They suddenly go boom, said Stanislav, a retiree, describing the attacks. We are worried.Glide bombs have been deployed by Russian forces to pound Ukrainian frontline positions throughout the war, and have been used against cities close to the Russian border, like Kharkiv, in recent months. But major cities farther from the border, like Zaporizhzhia, that were once seen as out of reach of the weapons are increasingly being struck, local officials, residents and military experts say.",

            "text": "Jaxson Darts feathered blond hair was tucked under a black hoodie, zipped tightly to his chin. Stone-faced, the quarterback couldnt stop shaking his head in disbelief.I dont understand how we lost, he said.We should win that game, coach Lane Kiffin said.Ole Miss had already suffered a loss to Kentucky. This one landed harder.AdvertisementWe have followed a plan that was deliberate and intentional to make an effort to be in this first 12-team Playoff, said Walker Jones, the executive director of The Grove Collective. That started two years ago.It culminated this fall, Jones said, having invested more than $10 million into a roster loaded with talent and highly recruited transfers. Jones said that number likely ranks among the top half of SEC programs.No. 18 Ole Miss goal is still technically in reach, but the 29-26 overtime loss to LSU on Oct. 12 sharply steepened the odds. Among the remaining opponents this season is No. 2 Georgia. The Rebels host Oklahoma this Saturday.Name, image and likeness, with the NCAA forced by the courts to allow athletes to monetize it in 2021, quickly became the most important fuel for roster building in college sports endless arms race. Third-party collectives affiliated with schools became responsible for facilitating it, and Ole Miss was among the schools at the forefront of using the transfer portal to its advantage.GO DEEPER College football portal confidential: How tampering, NIL deals and portal chaos happenNow, even as the way of doing business is changing again amid the House v. NCAA settlement, and with Ole Miss saddled with two losses, it would be easy to decry the roster as money wasted, to point to a program that fell short of its goals.Jones has the same response to that sentiment he gave to countless donors during two years spent frantically fundraising.I dont know if were going to get to the Playoff, he said, days before the loss to LSU. But I know how were not gonna get there. Were not gonna get there if we dont invest in a plan and commit to it.Jones was a former Ole Miss team captain and linebacker from 1994 to 1997 who later worked as the director of sports marketing for Under Armour and became an agent. He founded his own business before agreeing to lead Ole Miss NIL collective in the middle of 2022.To educate the fan base and put a face on Ole Miss approach to NIL, he convinced athletic director Keith Carter to hold a news conference alongside him and Rebels coaches that fall. Despite alerting the SEC beforehand, that aggressive approach earned Carter a cautionary call from the conference afterward.AdvertisementOle Miss, Carter said, is intentional about being aggressive as a means of making up ground between it and competition with bigger budgets and that has had more success traditionally.The NIL world and compliance, its a lot about risk management now. How far do you think you should go? Can you go? Weve walked that tightrope pretty well. Weve been aggressive, Carter said. And weve done well with some of those calculated risks. And the playing field is leveled some with the new model.Jones built relationships with big-money donors and built a subscription platform for fans who could pledge only tens or hundreds of dollars a month.On the field, Dart was showing promise as a sophomore first-year starter. The winds of change were blowing heavily toward an expanded Playoff, making Ole Miss dreams of inclusion more within reach. That December, the 12-team Playoff to launch in 2024 became official.We made a decision with coach Kiffin and others that said, Hey, if were gonna get in that 12-team Playoff, we need to start now, Jones said. I stop short of saying all-in, Playoff-or-bust narrative. But it was an intentional and deliberate approach to put a team together this year to be one of those 12.Roster building means managing three worlds: high school recruiting, roster retention and, yes, the portal. The collective must work closely with the coaching staff.Kiffin quickly agreed to stay mostly uninvolved with how much players were making, Jones said, and The Grove Collective leaves coaches out of financial decisions and negotiations with players. Like most of the more well-funded collectives, The Grove Collective has its own system of metrics and analytics it uses to find valuations for individual players, based on their positions and the teams needs.In 2023, Ole Miss signed 23 prospects to land the nations No. 2 transfer class, according to 247Sports, building on what Ole Miss had already started when it also landed the No. 2 class in 2022. Only four teams signed more transfers, and Louisiana Tech transfer Tre Harris highlighted the class. Harris leads the nation in receiving and had a highlight touchdown catch in the loss to LSU before being sidelined by an injury.AdvertisementIn 2024, the Rebels added 25 more transfers to sign the nations top portal class, with Kiffin embracing his status as the sports Portal King. Five-star defensive lineman Walter Nolen came from Texas A&M to highlight the class alongside Florida edge rusher transfer Princely Umanmielen, Alabama corner transfer Trey Amos and South Carolina receiver transfer Antwane Wells Jr.In the first year, the collective, Jones said, spent far less on roster retention than in the next year. Key contributors wanted to be paid more for their efforts.The speed-dating aspect of recruiting the portal meant enlisting team leaders like Dart, Harris and 325-pound, two-way player JJ Pegues to vet players and sign off on the dynamics of bringing transfer players into the program after they visited campus.The market is settling, Jones said, but any good collective has to be nimble entering each new portal window as players, agents and collectives learn more about how to operate. And the portal works both ways.Star running back Quinshon Judkins announced in January he was leaving Ole Miss for Ohio State after rushing for more than 2,700 yards and 31 touchdowns the previous two seasons. Ohio State athletic director Ross Bjork told ESPN earlier this offseason the Buckeyes had $20 million to spend on their 2024 football roster.Jones and The Grove Collectives efforts in two short years have made waves. Kiffin said in a news conference earlier this year that former Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze had attempted to pull Jones from his alma mater to help Auburn operate its collective. Jones said he got a chuckle out of it.In September, Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek called out Arkansas fans at an event and said they needed to grow their numbers to be more like Ole Miss collective.AdvertisementNobody loves that Ole Miss is in the top five, right? No. We hate it, Yurachek told cameras and a crowd gathered at an event for program supporters.The Grove Collective boasts 6,000 paid subscribers, Jones said, a large portion of whom had never given to Ole Miss before the NIL era and are under 35.But the shocking home loss to Kentucky and the crushing defeat in Death Valley have caused the wheels underneath the fast start to wobble. What now?This isnt a one-shot wonder. Were going to continually build rosters that are relevant nationally and in the top 12 and trying to get into the Playoff every year, Carter said. If we dont get in the Playoff this year, it isnt over. Were just getting started.What that looks like in the future is still unfolding. The House v. NCAA settlement, granted preliminary approval earlier this month, could bring new rules and guidelines to roster management as soon as the summer of 2025.Some collectives might be brought in-house. Some might partner with schools. Some might stay independent but closely connected to the athletic departments they bolster. Each school will have to decide which model fits it best. The NCAA is looking to monitor true market value with a clearinghouse that would vet all NIL deals worth more than $600.Revenue sharing, a major result of the settlement, with schools paying players directly, is expected to be set at a little more than $20 million next year and will rise as television deals grow more valuable.The limited information we have is there will be two buckets of money: the revenue sharing thats mandated from the settlement and incremental, third-party, market-based NIL, Jones said. The second bucket, NIL, will be much harder to police and value, and there isnt going to be a cap to it. One school might say, Were gonna spend another $30 million on top of that rev share. Another school might say, Well, we only have $5 million we can spend.Jones and The Grove Collective want to make sure Ole Miss is closer to the first group than the second.(Photo of Ole Miss players Jamarious Brown, left, and Walter Nolen: Jonathan Bachman / Getty Images)",

The gap by education is 29 points, with Mr. Trump ahead 10 points among people without a college degree and Ms. Harris ahead 19 points among those with one. But broken up by gender and education, we see that the gaps are driven particularly by men without a college degree and women with a college degree, with an overall difference of 43 points. Source: Pew Research, survey of U.S. adults conducted from Sept. 30 to Oct. 6, 2024.We are truly looking at two different Americas when we dig into the views of men without college degrees and women with college degrees. They are at opposite ends of the spectrum politically and experience essentially separate economies, and therefore give priority to distinct sets of character traits and issues.Lets take a closer look. Women with college degrees, who are generally more financially secure than other women, name abortion as one of the key issues deciding their vote, while both women and men without degrees tend to focus more on issues affecting their day-to-day finances or safety. While inflation affects everyone, it hits non-college-educated voters who feel they are falling behind hardest, especially now that the unemployment rate has been rising among those with less than a high school diploma.Our research indicates that economic issues matter deeply to many men without a college degree, who respond strongly to populist messages aimed at acknowledging their anxiety, sense of loss and resentment.These two groups also consume media in entirely different ways, which affects what they see and hear. Men  including those without college degrees  often spend time on X and Reddit, and many listen to podcasts and YouTube personalities concentrating on gaming, sports and politics. Women are more likely to frequent TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. Many seem more focused on content about personal growth, true crime and style.With the contrasts in priorities and worldview between these two groups, it makes sense that they would have different voting patterns, and the presence of a woman on the Democratic ticket has only accentuated that. Recent polling by the Pew Research Center shows non-college-educated men choosing Mr. Trump at a rate of 55 percent to 39 percent; college-educated women are nearly the inverse, favoring Ms. Harris by 61 percent to 34 percent. The gap may be even bigger by Election Day; it could be the largest in history.The large split between non-college-educated men and college-educated women began in 2016 +20 R (poll) Non-college men +10 R 0 43 pt. gap +10 D 39 pt. gap 41 pt. gap +20 D College women +30 D KerrY Bush Obama McCain Obama Romney Clinton Trump Biden Trump Harris Trump +40 D 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 +20 Rep.

KerrY Bush Obama McCain Obama Romney Clinton Trump Biden Trump Harris Trump +40 Dem. 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 Sources: American National Election Studies, Pew ResearchThis isnt a new trend. College-educated women have consistently voted for Democrats at high levels for years. But the divergence between non-college-educated men and college-educated women this year seems likely to surpass even its 2016 level.Mr. Trumps appeal to non-college-educated men is part of whats driving this shift. Before 2016, the gap between college-educated women and non-college-educated men was not as broad. But while Joe Biden made inroads among non-college-educated men in 2020, gaining 5 percent more of their vote compared to Hillary Clintons share in 2016, current support for Ms. Harris among men without college degrees has dropped back down almost to Mrs. Clintons 2016 levels. This could certainly in part be due to gender biases; non-college-educated men tend to be less receptive to the idea of women in executive positions. A study found that men without college degrees are least confident that a woman has what it takes to run a major American company (78 percent are confident compared to 91 percent of college-educated women). Our research suggests that they worry whether women are strong enough, can be respected by foreign leaders and are able to boost manufacturing.This campaign in particular shows that both parties have problems with key demographics. Years ago, Democrats could count on support from male union workers, but Mr. Trump is increasingly winning over those voters  not only because of his direct, emotional appeals to their anxiety and values, but also because Democrats have struggled to establish a compelling enough populist economic message or break into the media ecosystem that non-college-educated men consume.Mr. Trumps running mate, JD Vance, seems to have an especially potent attraction for some of these working-class voters. Increasingly, Republicans are the party of working- and middle-class people, said Mr. Vance, whose familys working-class background could be a powerful tool to bring in these non-college-educated men who turned to Mr. Biden in 2020, particularly white ones.As for Ms. Harris, she is particularly appealing to educated women. Republicans used to be stronger than Democrats with college-educated women, but that started to change in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan. Contemporaneous research indicated that educated women were more secular and more progressive on social issues than other voters at the time. They also supported government programs to provide a safety net and opportunity for all (sound familiar?). They opposed the Reagan tax cuts and deregulation and feared war. But many stuck with the Republican Party through the 2000s as part of the security mom coalition. We saw echoes of this in 2022 when Republican candidates in New York and elsewhere were able to leverage safety concerns to win over enough of these women to prevail on Election Day.Donald Trump on Joe Rogans podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, via YoutubeKamala Harris on Bren Browns podcast Bren Brown, via FacebookMs. Harris has been able to use abortion rights to bring back some women with college degrees who might otherwise have stayed with the Republicans. She already had a record of defending reproductive rights, and this year, she visited swing states to speak about abortion. Even in the early days of her campaign, she focused on abortion rights, vowing to restore the rights that had been enshrined in Roe v. Wade and organizing events in battleground states devoted to the issue. Women with college degrees were already a core base for Ms. Harris and the Democratic Party, but these moves helped increase her support among women of all ages. She and her campaign know that she needs to register and turn out voters who favor abortion rights to offset the non-college-educated men Mr. Trump is poised to win.While it might seem impossible for a candidate to appeal to both non-college-educated men and college-educated women, there are areas where policies and messaging could bridge the gap.A populist message, for example, could win more men without college degrees without alienating college-educated women, as anti-corporate sentiment is common among voters across the political spectrum and can play into concerns about both economic issues and freedom from control. Either party could leverage this sentiment.Both groups seem to want investments in public education and job skills training. Many in both groups are worried the next generation will not be as well off as the one before. Many want clean air and water and worry about pollution. Non-college-educated men tend to want to preserve natural areas for recreation like hunting, our data indicates, while college-educated women are particularly concerned about climate change. Both groups seek more respect and power, our research shows, and both see politics as a zero-sum game. The divide between these two groups seems unlikely to change before Election Day, but for either party to bridge the gap in the long term, it will need to work to appeal to both groups.The story of this election could well be the gender gap between those Americans who went to college and those who didnt. As the candidates consolidate support among their base, the divide between college-educated women and non-college-educated men seems almost impossible for Ms. Harris or Mr. Trump to overcome. The big question for America going forward is, can these two groups be brought together after a campaign that has only driven them further apart?Celinda Lake, president of Lake Research Partners, was one of two lead pollsters for Joe Bidens 2020 presidential campaign.

            "text": "Once Top Advisers to Trump, They Now Call Him Liar, Fascist and Unfit Many of those who served in former President Donald J. Trumps administration  especially his generals, ambassadors and other national security officials  have since turned on Mr. Trump.Former President Donald J. Trump often brags about hiring the best people. But the breadth of the criticism aimed at Mr. Trump, especially from his own former military and national security officials, sets him apart from any modern president.Gen. Mark Milley Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman John Kelly Chief of staff John Bolton National security adviser Nikki Haley U.N. ambassador Rex Tillerson Secretary of state Mike Pompeo Secretary of state Play John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general who served as Mr. Trumps chief of staff, recently called his former boss an authoritarian, saying he admires people who are dictators  he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.Mark Milley, the countrys top military official during the last two years of Mr. Trumps presidency, privately told the journalist Bob Woodward that Mr. Trump is a fascist to the core and said his pursuit of another four years in office makes him the most dangerous person to this country, Mr. Woodward revealed in a recent book.Mr. Trump and those around him rejected the criticism as little more than sour grapes. The former president has called General Milley a loser and worse, and has suggested that the decorated military officer should be executed for treason because of efforts to ease concerns among foreign leaders after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by Mr. Trumps supporters.But the comments from Mr. Kelly and General Milley denigrating Mr. Trumps capacity to serve as commander in chief are particularly striking, even as they echo the sentiments from others across his government and many Republicans outside of his administration.Former generals, admirals, diplomats, intelligence officers and security strategists have publicly or privately accused Mr. Trump of being a liar who lacks basic knowledge about the world and represents a danger to democracy. Members of his cabinet have questioned his loyalty to the country and testified to his chaotic behavior. His press aides have talked about his lack of integrity and his tendency to attack others.And Mike Pence, his own vice president, has accused him of being reckless and putting himself over the Constitution. And Mr. Pence said he walked away from the agenda backed by conservatives. Mr. Pence ran against Mr. Trump and refused to endorse him.Only a few of the former presidents advisers have played an active role in trying to defeat Mr. Trumps bid for another four years in power, often citing their belief that military and national security officials should not meddle in partisan politics. Most have not appeared in ads or sat for recent TV interviews. Just a handful have endorsed Mr. Trumps opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.But they have not disowned their comments about the former president and the danger he poses if he returns to the Oval Office. In recent weeks, Ms. Harris has begun running campaign ads citing the comments from some of the former Trump officials as evidence that he is unfit to serve again.Mr. Trump could regain power soon, and those who advised him the first time have said he is A Threat to Democracy Mr. Trumps national security aides repeatedly described him as a danger to the country and to democracy. Many cited the Jan. 6 violence and his reaction to it as evidence of how he posed a threat to the countrys laws and norms. Others predicted a return to the White House would damage the countrys national security. Surely you cant mean Hitlers generals? And he said, Yeah, yeah, Hitlers generals. John Kelly Chief of staff , said in a recent interview, recalling when Mr. Trump praised the loyalty shown by German generals. Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people  does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. James Mattis Secretary of defense Donald Trump will cause a lot of damage if he is elected in a second term. John Bolton National security adviser The American people deserve to know that President Trump asked me to put him over my oath to the Constitution, but I kept my oath and I always will. Im running for president in part because I think that anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States. Mike Pence Vice presidentIll-Informed and Incurious Several officials have publicly questioned Mr. Trumps intelligence, accusing him of knowing little about history and saying they observed him struggling to understand the complexities of the presidency. Some said he appeared not to be interested in learning about the issues he confronted. Trump lacked basic knowledge of how the government runs, and his impatience with learning about the roles of his senior officials and about alternative models for decision-making limited his ability to lead. When there was conflict, he avoided it or, at times, stoked it. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser His understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of U.S. history was really limited. Its really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesnt even understand the concept for why were talking about this. Rex Tillerson Secretary of state His short attention span (except on matters of personal advantage) renders coherent foreign policy almost unattainable. The United States missed an incalculable number of opportunities in Trumps first term because senior officials necessarily concentrated on keeping a few key policies on track. John Bolton National security adviserDishonest Some members of Mr. Trumps national security team accused him of lying while he was president. Several said he fabricated stories or willingly ignored facts. Others said they witnessed him lying about the results of the 2020 election despite knowing the truth. Trump was caught in a vortex created by the interaction of those narratives with the fragility of his ego and his deep sense of aggrievement. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser Our president must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country. The most important being truth. This president is not able to do that. James Comey F.B.I. director , said after Mr. Trump fired him from his job So many people who had access to his ear who were telling him things, most of which were untrue, and then he began to listen to those voices and form a view that had no basis in fact. Rex Tillerson Secretary of stateMisplaced in His Loyalty Some former aides said Mr. Trump was not loyal to his constituents because he failed to follow a standard conservative agenda. Many questioned his loyalty to the country after witnessing his actions after the election of 2020. Others said he proved disloyal by ignoring rules that govern how sensitive documents are handled. His ego and love of self distorted his perception of the 2020 presidential election. His sense of betrayal drove him to abandon his oath to support and defend the Constitution, a presidents highest obligation. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser He thought I would be loyal and obedient to him. I told him we were loyal to our oath to the Constitution. If he told you to slit someones throat, he thought you would go out and do it. John Kelly White House chief of staff The president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices. Richard Spencer Secretary of the NavyDisorderly and Undisciplined National security advisers and military officials working for Mr. Trump said he created political and diplomatic chaos while in office. Some said they believed he enjoyed causing discord, while others said he pursued policies that triggered strife and disagreement among global allies. Some said he had a temper that added to the sense of chaos. He acts on his instincts. In some respects, that looks like impulsiveness, but its not his intent to act on impulse. I think he really is trying to act on his instincts. Rex Tillerson Secretary of state Hes getting meaner and more offensive by the day. Hes trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. Nikki Haley U.N. ambassador , said while she was running against Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. John Kelly White House chief of staffA Lawbreaker Several of his national security advisers noted that Mr. Trump faces multiple indictments , including federal charges that he sought to overturn the 2020 election. He has denied breaking the law in all of the cases. This is beyond wrong and illegal. Its un-American. The President undermined American democracy baselessly for months. Tom Bossert Homeland security adviser , said after the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6 Ive never seen a defendant beg for it more. By attacking the judge, attacking the jury, attacking the witnesses. James Comey F.B.I. director , said when asked if Mr. Trump would be sentenced to jail time after being convicted of falsifying business records. Todays violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump. James Mattis Secretary of defenseLacking in Integrity One common theme among the former presidents most senior military and national security officials was what some described as a lack of integrity. Several said he was motivated only by self-interest, rather than what was good for the country or the government. Others commented on his ego or used the word unfit to describe him. I think hes unfit for office.  He puts himself before country. His actions are all about him and not about the country. Mark Esper Secretary of defense The facts, however, are clear that he is unfit to be President. If his first four years were bad, a second four will be worse, dismaying many ardent supporters. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty. James Comey F.B.I. directorSimilar warnings about Mr. Trump have come from his other top advisers: almost half of his cabinet, as well as his attorney general, among others. These officials rang the alarm both during and after Mr. Trumps presidency  in books, interviews, essays, speeches and television appearances.People who once worked for Mr. Trump at the highest levels now describe him as unintelligent, chaotic, a danger to American democracy and more. What follows is not an exhaustive list, but rather a representative collection of criticism from Mr. Trumps top advisers.",

            "text": "Let me apologize in advance for cheating a bit.We use the term breakout like its just spontaneous combustion, but thats rarely how it happens. Like most reactions, usually they require a catalyst. Thus, the inherent issue about calling a breakout in advance is that often the term isnt quite what were describing. Instead, the real breakout is one of opportunity, in the form of minutes and touches, rather than one of rapidly changing levels of play.AdvertisementFor example, check out last seasons Most Improved Player award winner, the Philadelphia 76ers Tyrese Maxey. Yes, he has made steady progress since his rookie year in 2020. But the big change for him last season wasnt about his own game; it was about the departure of James Harden days into the season. That transaction opened the door for Maxey to become Phillys primary on-ball initiator, increase his usage rate from 24.1 percent to 28.0 percent and up his scoring rate from 20.3 per game to 25.9.Youll find similar storylines littering the field when looking at my All-Breakout squad for this season, consisting of 11 players I think have a chance to significantly boost their production from a year ago.The Basketball 100 The story of the greatest players in NBA history. In 100 riveting profiles, top basketball writers justify their selections and uncover the history of the NBA in the process. The story of the greatest plays in NBA history. Pre-orderSo, back to the cheating  Ill also note that I cheated a second time since I already have 1/82 of the answers to the test. Its a little easier to come up with an All-Breakout Team when you already have a peek at how minutes and touches will work for most of these teams after a few days of games.That said, projecting breakouts can be a bit harder than it looks. Injuries, slumps and our misperceptions caused by our tiny human brains can easily send a potential breakout sideways. Take a gander at last seasons list, for instance.I had the Most Improved Player (Maxey), but none of the other 13 players who received votes made my list. I had Anthony Edwards, Chet Holmgren and Scottie Barnes on my team, all of whom genuinely broke out  but I also had LaMelo Ball and Mikal Bridges. And then theres Charlottes Mark Williams, who seemed like an easy call 12 months ago. He ended up playing 19 games.With that said, let me bravely charge ahead into my list for this year. I tried to represent every level of the playing spectrum, so along with a few players who are already big stars, I have some deep cuts in secondary roles.AdvertisementMy 11-man All-Breakout Team for 2024-25:This isnt just me riding the wave of Davis dominant opening night performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Hes low-key been on a heater for the last few months; Davis was one of the most productive players in preseason, even when most veterans throttle down to coasting speed, and was one of the best players on Team USAs gold-medal winning squad.Before that, he finished his 2023-24 regular season strong and was fantastic in the Lakers five-game, first-round defeat against the Denver Nuggets, averaging 27.8 points on 67 percent shooting and a playoff-leading 15.6 boards. Hes also, thankfully, playing full-time as a center, which is his most productive position even if he doesnt like it.Health and shooting will always be the swing variables for Davis, but hes off to a good start on those fronts as well  he even made an above-the-break 3 in the opener. The bar is high for a breakout here, but with 39-year-old LeBron James volume possibly on the downslope and few others capable of soaking up the extra chances, this could be a career year for Davis.GO DEEPER Anthony Davis gives Lakers an early dose of hope  and a long-awaited blueprintDyson Daniels, SG, AtlantaThis one isnt the usual case of a player breaking out because of an increase in touches and shots. This is a defensive breakout, where Daniels is being thrust into a role as the Hawks defensive stopper. He was a force at that end in New Orleans, but his role fluctuated because of a crowded backcourt and his iffy shooting, limiting him to 22 minutes per game across 61 appearances and just 17 total minutes in the playoffs.That wont be the case in Atlanta, where the Hawks have been desperate for an elite defender on the perimeter. The 6-foot-8, 21-year-old Daniels is starting and likely will see big minutes as along as his offense is at least somewhat threatening. If so, he has a great chance to lead the league in steals (he had five on opening night and was second in the NBA in steal rate a year ago) and a decent shot at cracking one of the All-Defensive teams.Zion Williamson, PF/C, New OrleansThis one is a pure eye-test call: Williamson finished last season playing the best basketball of his career. He was in the midst of destroying the Lakers in a Play-In game when his hamstring betrayed him. All that seems to have carried over to this year, where he looks fantastic in preseason  statistically, sure, but even more so physically, exploding past people as he did as a rookie and accumulating heaps of layups.AdvertisementAll of this is juiced by his expected positional move to center. Even if it isnt full-time, he should have enough reps at that spot that he can feast blowing past overmatched centers or compromising defenses as a rim-running screener if they try to match up smaller against him.Williamson missed the Pelicans opener with an illness, but that should be a quick absence. I dont know exactly how many games well see of this version of him, but Im excited about the possibility of seeing a full-ish season of peak Williamson. This feels like the season we might get it.GO DEEPER What's behind Zion Williamson's newfound drive? TrustAmen Thompson, positionless, HoustonBetween Wembymania and Thompsons early-season injury, the hype machine for the fourth pick in the 2023 draft never really got rolling. I think that might change this year, when Thompson has a greater chance to establish himself as a hybrid center-guard-not-sure-what-to-call-it dynamo who can blow up offenses with his switchy, twitchy athleticism and wreak havoc in transition at the other end.There are some barriers, as we saw on opening night. Thompson is coming off the bench, and his lack of shooting is exacerbated by a roster that already doesnt have much reliable spacing. He still has to become a more refined decision-maker to take advantage of his ballhandling and athleticism too. That said, Thompsons fine rookie season (18.2 PER, 57.6 percent true shooting, mammoth rebound and steal + block rates) largely went under the radar a season ago, and that doesnt figure to be the case this season on a Houston squad that should be a League Pass favorite.Josh Giddey, PG/SF, ChicagoGiddy only had a lukewarm opener against New Orleans feisty wing defenders, but Ill stay on the bandwagon here. He should fit in his role in Chicago much more easily than he did in Oklahoma City as an on-ball creator with limited shooting gravity. That should provide him more opportunity to grow in some of the other areas (drawing fouls, defense, catch-and-shoots, etc.), where his limitations dragged him down with the Thunder. Additionally, Chicagos situation should give Giddey a lot more opportunities to play through mistakes and develop on the floor.Not that hes chopped liver now. The 22-year-old is a plus passer and rebounder with an excellent floater game and good court vision, and for what its worth, hes also one of the best inbound passers in basketball. That hes also playing for a contract after he and the Bulls didnt reach an extension this past week is another reason to believe in him taking a big step up.GO DEEPER Why teams held the line at the extension deadline, and which clubs made out bestJalen Williams, SF, Oklahoma CityJust because its obvious doesnt mean it isnt true. The Thunder badly need a secondary shot creator to step up, especially with the aforementioned Giddey gone, and Williams is the clear candidate to soak up a lot of those touches and shots.Hes also shown the capability of being a player who can handle that added responsibility efficiently, as hes proven up to the challenge at each step of his development in his first two seasons with the Thunder. Again, its not just about the opportunity here, but about Williams having the talent to sustain a greater role on a winning team. For what its worth, Williams was awesome in his four preseason games, with a 30.1 PER on 66.3 percent true shooting.AdvertisementRJ Barrett, SF, TorontoIf a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears, it, does it makes a sound? What if, instead of a forest, its Canada?Barrett was already showing signs of turning a corner last season in New York, then played significantly better after the trade in Toronto. Nobody noticed because it happened in the general destitution of the Raptors 2023-24 season, but Barrett is becoming a dude.In 32 games as a Raptor, Barrett averaged 21.4 points per game and shot 60.5 percent on 2s. The eye test backed it up; there was more comfort and control in the finishing, more nuanced shot selection and distribution and even (gasp) the occasional right-handed attack.He built on that in the summer by arguably being Canadas second-best Olympian, averaging 19.8 points on blistering 70.1 percent true shooting. While we didnt see him in preseason due to a sprained AC joint, hes listed as day-to-day and expected to rejoin the action soon, so it shouldnt slow him down too much.Entering his age-24 season, on a roster with basically four real players and some serious question marks, Barrett should have plenty of room to explore his limits and continue refining his hard-charging downhill game.Tre Mann makes a move against Miles McBride and the Knicks. (John Jones / USA Today Network via Imagn Images)Tre Mann, SG, CharlotteMann is single-handedly trying to bring baggy back. Seeing him on the court in his 178-pound frame and size XXXXL jersey and shorts, it looks like one of those in-game promotions where they have kids put on an NBA players uniform then run around and try to score a basket.Mann, however, is pretty good at the latter part. He scored 24 points in Charlottes upset of Houston on opening night, continuing a positive stretch of basketball dating to his trade from the Thunder last spring. Mann was one of the leagues most effective players statistically in preseason, which does have some predictive value, and quietly averaged double figures in 28 games for the Hornets at the end of last season.AdvertisementThis was a bit of a surprise, as he had struggled to gain traction for three years in Oklahoma City, and its possible his lack of size for a two guard and limited playmaking for a point guard restrict him going forward. As with Giddey above, theres also a financial incentive. The Hornets could have extended Mann this past week (hes on the last year of his rookie deal) and instead opted to wait and gather more information.Julian Strawther, SF, DenverIm not even cheating on this one because the Nuggets hadnt played yet when I wrote this. But Strawther seems to be at the right nexus of opportunity and production. He was eighth in the NBA in preseason scoring, and the Nuggets desperately need him to fill a void in the wing rotation created by Kentavious Caldwell-Popes departure. He also has the specific skill set they most crave, as a high-volume 3-point shooter on a team that was last in 3-point rate a year ago.Strawthers rookie season with the Nuggets was mostly spent watching, and his NBA minutes didnt go all that well with an 8.2 PER and 29.7 percent 3-point shooting. However, the 22-year-old from Gonzaga has thrived in other settings  hes had two strong summer leagues in addition to his 2024 preseason  and small-sample shooting variance explains much of his poor stats from 2023-24.Cam Thomas green light, BrooklynIm not sure whether this qualifies as a genuine breakout or just something thats going to be fun as hell to watch. But if were talking about touches and opportunity? Sheesh. Thomas had 36 points on 27 shots opening night in Atlanta, and if you look at the Nets roster, that trend line seems likely to continue. Theres just nobody else on the team who can create shot volume like Thomas, and the volume will only increase if Brooklyn moves Dennis Schrders expiring contract.Thomas has always been a high-volume player, ranking sixth in the league in field goal frequency a year ago. However, the criticism was about quality, not quantity. In the past, there have been too many tough 2-point jumpers and little in the way of playmaking, both of which dragged down his efficiency. Thomas corrected some of that in the opener, getting off 13 3-point attempts and making seven, and interjecting at least a couple of passing reads that let you talk yourself into growth there.After 48 hours, he was third in the NBA in field goal attempts and second in scoring. With few other options on the Nets roster and operating in a contract year, Thomas may stay near the top of both columns all season.This isnt quite on Thomas level, but Powell is in a contract year and looks set to re-establish at least some of his value on a Clippers team that really needs his scoring. Or maybe, as a Cheers fan, I just like to yell out Norm! occasionally.AdvertisementEither way, Powell will be the second option next to James Harden for as long as Kawhi Leonard is out. When Leonard returns, Powell will likely revert to a sixth man role. A 17-point, four-assist opener in Phoenix is a good start for this trend line, and Powell did this while going 1 of 7 from 3 (hes a 39.4 percent career shooter from distance).Powell has the added benefit of no longer having to watch the Russell Westbrook show when he checks in with the Clippers subs. Instead, with Leonard injured and Paul George departed, it mostly will be his show any time Harden is off the floor. While Powell thrives best as a secondary scorer rather than a get-out-of-my-way guy, hell also have significant overlap with Harden where he can thrive off the ball. At age 31, he could end up threatening his career-high scoring average of 19.6 from back in Toronto.Sign up to get The Bounce, the essential NBA newsletter from Zach Harper and The Athletic staff, delivered free to your inbox.(Photo of Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson: Tyler Kaufman / Getty Images)",

            "text": "Shohei Ohtani has been a superstar in Japan for more than a decade, but one day earlier this year, a Tokyo resident named Tatsuo Shinke noticed something different.Shinke, the CEO of Mint, a leading trading card store, had already watched as Ohtanis soaring popularity had fueled the Japanese collectibles industry, spiked Japanese television ratings for Major League Baseball, and pushed baseball news into every corner and crevice of the countrys vast media ecosystem.AdvertisementYet as Ohtani made history in his first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming the first player in history to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in one season, Shinke observed another data point: His mother, Emiko.At 73 years old, Emiko had never followed baseball. But because Ohtanis Dodgers games are aired live in the morning in Japan, and because he has become a daily fixture on the countrys popular morning variety shows  the equivalent of Good Morning America or Today  Emiko developed a new morning routine: She wakes up, eats breakfast, and then turns on Ohtani.Elderly people in Japan love Ohtani, Shinke said. Its my mother. And all my mothers friends. Shes retired already, so she has enough time to watch all the games in the morning.In the United States, the World Series between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers is a matchup featuring the countrys two biggest cities and most high-profile franchises. The audience could surpass 20 million viewers per game for the first time since 2016.In Japan, it will likely be even bigger.In seven seasons in the majors, including six for the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani has lorded his talent over Major League Baseball in a manner previously thought impossible. For his trouble, he has captured two Most Valuable Player awards while dominating as a hitter and a pitcher. If he wins his third this November, as is expected, he will become the first full-time designated hitter to win the award, a role he was forced to play after injuring his elbow last season.At World Series Media Day on Thursday, no one was a bigger draw than Ohtani. (Katharine Lotze / Getty Images)In America, his performance earned him a $700 million contract  the largest in history  and stardom in a sport that increasingly trails its rivals in cultural capital. But back home in Japan, where baseball is the most popular sport, Ohtanis celebrity has reached stratospheric levels, akin to Michael Jordan or David Beckham, figures who transcended their field of play and whose fame turned them into international avatars for their home country.AdvertisementThere isnt a person in Japan who doesnt know who Ohtani is, I dont think, said Robert Whiting, an American author in Tokyo who has written about Japanese baseball since the 1970s.When the Dodgers defeated the Padres in Game 5 of the National League Division Series  a game that featured two Japanese starting pitchers  an estimated audience of 12.9 million Japanese viewers tuned in at 9 a.m. on a Saturday, at least 5.4 million more than watched in the U.S. When Ohtani chased 50-50 in September, his exploits often led the national nightly news and daytime wide shows, spaces that rarely mention sports. (The business newspaper Nikkei also ran a front-page story above the fold.) And when Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, spoke of Ohtani during a press conference in Tokyo earlier this season, he told reporters he wanted to speak not as an ambassador but as a kid from Chicago who watched Jordan rule the 1990s and transcend basketball.This is early on in Ohtani-sans career, Emanuel said, but theres no doubt that thats what he has right now.The sheer volume of wall-to-wall coverage has even surprised Whiting, who first moved to Tokyo in the 1960s and has authored books on baseball and Japanese culture. Japan has seen this story before, the obsession over conquering baseball heroes in the form of Hideo Nomo, Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui, who was World Series MVP for the Yankees in 2009. But perhaps not since Nomo in the 1990s, Whiting says, has a Japanese player embodied and lifted the national spirit.When Nomo debuted for the Dodgers in 1995  in the middle of a nasty trade dispute between the United States and Japan  Whiting recalled that Asahi Shimbun, one of the nations biggest newspapers, ran an editorial stating: In Hideo Nomo, the Japanese have produced a product that no one is complaining about. But whereas Nomo, Suzuki and later pitchers like Yu Darvish validated the quality of Japanese baseball, Ohtani has changed the equation: For the first time, Japanese fans can credibly argue that the most talented baseball player of all time is from Japan.AdvertisementIn the global market, Japanese value and power is (becoming) a little bit weaker, year by year, said Tomoki Negishi, a baseball marketing executive who worked for Japans Pacific League. So Ohtani-sans great performance is a beacon.To some, he says, Ohtani is a symbol of Japan in the global market.To others?He is just a crazy superhero that Ive never seen before, Negishi says.On the morning of October 12, the symbol beamed through a television into a living room in ta, a special ward in Tokyo. Masanori Ninomiya, an owner of an English reading company, finished a traditional breakfast of white rice, miso soup and fruit and then turned on the Dodgers and Padres.Ninomiya, 59, grew up in the city of Oita, obsessing over books about Japanese baseball history. He attended business school at UCLA in the 90s, as Nomo was breaking through. He is among those in Tokyo who work remotely, which allows him to put the Dodgers on in the background during the work week.Everybody will have a breakfast, he said And then its Ohtani.In Japan, all Dodgers games appear on NHK, the countrys free, over-the-air public broadcaster. The audience for NHK often skews older, especially in the mornings. Unlike the United States, where European soccer fans huddle in bars and pubs in the morning, there is less public consumption of Ohtani, outside of major events like the World Baseball Classic. According to Negishi, this is partly due to cultural norms and partly because of the sheer volume of baseball games.Im sure Im not the only one, said Chen Liang, director of imports at Mint cards and collectibles. But theres a huge percentage of Japanese people who are at work, and theyre in front of their computer, and theyre just clicking on the box score while they look at Excel sheets and things like that.AdvertisementNinomiya was awed by Ohtani when he emerged as a two-way player for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. He followed him when he debuted with the Angels in 2018, when the morning ritual began. But he ascribes the national love affair to the way Ohtani has conducted himself on the MLB stage.For example, if theres garbage on the ground, he tries to pick it up, Ninomiya said. We know hes a superstar  and super rich  but he doesnt behave like that.Ohtani and his representatives have cultivated an image in Japan of a modest, polite baseball star who is deferential to teammates and respectful to elders. The reputation helped Ohtani weather a wave of public scrutiny earlier this year, when his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was charged with stealing more than $16 million from an Ohtani bank account to cover gambling debts. (Mizuhara later pleaded guilty.) Its also helped him land a raft of endorsements from companies on both sides of the Pacific and turn his personal life into daily fodder on television. (His wife, Mamiko Tanaka, and his dog, translated to Dekopin in Japanese, are regular characters on the daytime shows.)The comings and goings of Mamiko Tanaka and Ohtani are regular fodder for Japanese morning shows. (Stringer / Getty Images)Those are traits that I think Japanese fans love to see in practice on a foreign land, said Hiroshi Kitamura, an associate professor of history at William & Mary who specializes in U.S.-East Asian relations. Japanese fans love to see MLB players like (Aaron) Judge, (Fernando) Tatis, (Ronald) Acuna say great things about Ohtani as being the unicorn. But I think they also appreciate seeing Ohtani kind of being Japanese. In that sense, I think Japanese fans see Ohtani as part of them.The face of Major League Baseball greeted Foster Griffin each day when he arrived in Tokyo. The billboards. The cardboard likenesses in convenience stores. Ohtanis voice even features in advertisements on the subway.Soon after Griffin, a former Kansas City Royals pitcher, moved to Japan to pitch for the Yomiuri Giants, he learned the cultural primacy of televised nightly news.And he has his own section of the news, Griffin said. They highlight everything he does every day over there. Hes everywhere.AdvertisementFrom an American perspective, its hard to conceive of the popularity of Ohtani in Japan. America does not revere any foreign sports in which they are not supreme. The Japanese media, a sprawling apparatus with five commercial television networks and five national daily newspapers, can be impenetrable for non-Japanese speakers. And contrary to hyperbole, not everyone in Japan cares about baseball.Culturally, I felt like in recent years, the interest of young kids seemed headed to new sports like soccer, said Ema Ryan Yamazaki, a Japanese filmmaker raised in Osaka.The sport, however, remains a cultural unifier, a source of connection at the office or during the morning commute. And Ohtani has transcended demographics, spawning new generations of fans while appealing to retired grandmothers in Tokyo, Fukuoka and Sapporo.In Japan, Ohtani is the face of countless advertising campaigns. (Tomohiro Ohsumi / Getty Images)The school teacher understands a balk and an intentional walk, throughout the entire country, said Bobby Valentine, the former Mets manager who had two stints in Japan as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines. Its like a port of passage. Baseball allows you to be acceptable in the culture. Its just one of those things.When Ohtani led the country to a World Baseball Classic championship last year, more than 42 percent of Japanese households watched Japan defeat the United States at 8 a.m on a Wednesday. Six of Japans seven WBC games drew more than 30 million viewers. Ohtanis presence  along with starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto  could help the Japanese World Series audience approach those heights. The numbers are already so striking that MLB continues to target the Japanese market, and will open the 2025 season with the Dodgers facing the Chicago Cubs in Tokyo, a year after the Dodgers opened the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres. Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Athletic this week that If youre going to open (the season) in Tokyo, the only choice was to take the Dodgers again. And the reason its the only choice is the audiences that those games deliver are so big that it drives whats a real broadcast business for us in Japan.The first pitch of the World Series will come at 9:08 a.m. on Saturday, airing on both NHK and commercial network Fuji TV. Interest is so high that creators of the wildly popular manga show One Piece pushed back a season premiere, to not compete with Ohtani.Smart move to move the show on their part, Yamazaki said. I would, too.AdvertisementAs Ninomaya puts it, the only figure in Japan who could conceivably surpass Ohtani in name recognition is the prime minister, and the current one, Shigeru Ishiba, just took office earlier this month.Some young people may not know our prime minister, he said. But even kids  junior high school students, senior high school students  everybody knows Ohtani.Yes, every generation in Japan is ready for breakfast with Ohtani. Even if there is one that appears most charmed.Earlier this year, Whiting, 82, was talking to his wife, Machiko Kondo, who worked for years as a resettlement officer at the United Nations. For decades, Kondo never expressed any interest in baseball, even as Whiting wrote best-selling books about Japanese baseball history and the meaning of Ichiro, even as he followed games on both sides of the Pacific.But then came Ohtani.Ive written all these baseball books that have gotten national attention, and it doesnt mean anything to her, Whiting said. But now with Ohtani, shes started asking: Did Ohtani have any home runs?The Athletics Andy McCullough and Sam Blum contributed to this story(Illustration: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; Photos: Jayne Kamin-Oncea / Getty Photos)",

Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesThat is who Donald Trump is, but that is not who we are.If there is one line to take away from Kamala Harriss Tuesday night speech, not far from the White House, that seems like a good choice. With it, the vice president sought to remind us of the chaos and confusion that cling to the former president like slime on a shoe, while expressing the hope that Americans still have faith in themselves, and in one another, to demand better.That, more than anything, is what Harris was selling in her closing argument to that curious collection of voters still on the fence in this presidential race: A way to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the chaos and the division of Trumpism.As high-stakes speeches go, this one was solidly constructed and solidly delivered. Harris isnt an Obama-level orator, whether were talking Barack or Michelle. She acknowledged that many voters still dont feel that they know her well, and this appearance most likely didnt help much with that. It was loaded with platitudes and with sentimentality that wasnt quite personal enough to be moving or illuminating: Raised in a middle-class family. Instinct to protect the little guy. Always listen to you. Always tell you the truth. Never stop fighting for you. Build consensus. We need to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms? Oof.Once she got rolling, though, Harris did spend some time drawing distinctions between what she would do and what Trump would do, including: On Day 1, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. A little cheesy? Sure. But totally accurate, and the presence of the Oval Office right over her shoulder made it real.She then ran through her plans to help make homeownership more accessible, to fight for an expanded child tax credit, to invest in the caregiving economy  complete with a nice shout out to the struggling sandwich generation. In discussing immigration, she mentioned border security first thing. She vowed to fight for the reproductive rights stripped away by Trumps handpicked Supreme Court justices, and she talked up the need for a strong military.This reads like a down-to-earth, bread-and-butter to-do list  with a little something for everyone, and a little something for everyone to hate. Did she dig into the specifics of any of her proposals? No, she did not. This was neither the time nor the place.Harriss top job was to remind everyone what is at stake in this election. Of course, more than perhaps anything she said, her choice of setting drove that point home: the Ellipse at the south end of Presidents Park, the very place where the Jan. 6 riot took form as Trump whipped his supporters into a frenzy before unleashing them on the Capitol.Say this about the Trump era, it has taught everyone the value of political theater.It doesnt have to be this way, Harris reminded us.In another week, well see if shes right.",

            "text": "ASHBURN, Va.  His alarm buzzes at 4:45 each morning, but most days Jayden Daniels doesnt need it. Hes already awake, driving through the predawn darkness, pulling into an empty parking lot at 21300 Coach Gibbs Dr. The routine he started his final year at LSU has become a staple of his rookie season in the NFL.AdvertisementYou always here this early? Adam Peters asked after bumping into Daniels in the hallway around 5:30 a.m. a few weeks ago. Peters, the Commanders first-year general manager, was headed to the weight room. Daniels was about to watch some film.Usually, its a little earlier, Daniels told him. But I had to make an extra stop today.Peters looked down. Daniels was holding two boxes of donuts, gifts for his offensive linemen.For a while, his teammates didnt know he was showing up so early; Daniels studies with the door shut and doesnt tell anyone hes there. But in time, the car that kept beating them to the building, day after day, week after week, started to tell them something. A few started to wonder: is it normal for a quarterback to show up this early?Not normal for most, says linebacker Bobby Wagner, a 13-year veteran bound for the Hall of Fame. Normal for the great ones.After Washington took Daniels second in Aprils draft, the teams new center, Tyler Biadasz, figured hed start coming in early to work with the rookie on exchanges. He showed up at 6 one morning and realized he was late. Daniels was already on the practice field, repping that days walkthrough. Alone.GO DEEPER Jayden Daniels' growth with VR simulation has Commanders embracing mind gamesTerry McLaurin knew after his first practice. Daniels hadnt been on the field 15 minutes  hadnt been in the building a week  and he was already making checks at the line of scrimmage. Then the rookie made a throw that cut through the teeth of the defense, a throw McLaurin remembers in detail five months later.Heres why this play is different, the sixth-year Pro Bowl wideout says. The receivers running a crosser, and most guys wait to release it until he clears the hook defender in the middle of the field. They wait until that window opens up, you know?Jayden threw it before there even was a window. Ive never seen a rookie do that.AdvertisementLinebacker Frankie Luvu was on the field that day. He saw the throw. He knew, too.We gotta get our s right on defense, he told himself, because we got ourselves a quarterback.A quarterback? This team? After churning through 27 starters and 10 coaches during the Dan Snyder era  winning just two playoff games in 24 years  as one of the NFLs proud franchises dissolved into dysfunction?There were league investigations and Congressional hearings. Leaked emails. The name change. The railing collapse. RGIIIs knee. Cover-ups. Lawsuits. And losing. Years and years of losing.Ive seen this place from afar, and there was always this black cloud over it, says Washington tight end Zach Ertz, who spent eight-plus years beating up on the franchise as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles. This was an organization that always had talent, but you were never worried about them long-term.With new leadership, a guy like Jayden, the right group around him  this city has waited for this.Still, this is a scarred franchise and a scarred fan base trying to shake that lingering fear thats been beaten into them for 30 years.Paul Walker is 65. Hes wearing a burgundy Sonny Jurgensen No. 9, tailgating ahead of the Commanders Week 7 meeting with the Panthers. My first game in person since the Monday Night Massacre, he says, referring to the night 14 years ago when Eagles quarterback Michael Vick torched Washington for six touchdowns in a 59-28 win. We always got that mentality that somethings eventually gonna go wrong. It just always has.But Im telling you, this season is bringing me back to the Joe Gibbs years. Our quarterback might be the best one weve had since Walker pauses, then points to his chest, to Jurgensens No. 9.Rob Abelman fell in love with football during the Gibbs years. He used to tag along with his dad to games at RFK Stadium, and he watched two Super Bowl wins in person. Then he got so fed up with the team during Snyders run that he canceled his season tickets.AdvertisementThe minute he read Snyder was selling the team, he signed up for new ones. I have the belief because Ive seen it, says Abelman, who with his son, Jared, drives in from Philadelphia for games. (Jared) doesnt. Hes 24. All hes known his whole life is heartbreak.Sunday spoke to both. A 40-7 romp over Carolina  the NFC East-leading Commanders fifth win in six weeks  was tinged by Daniels first-quarter exit. Its a rib injury, not expected to be anything serious, but a reminder nonetheless for a fan base trying to convince itself its allowed to believe again.Hope remains a dangerous thing in the District.It started with an arena league quarterback drilling his dropbacks on an empty field just west of the San Bernardino Mountains. Ryan Porter was mid-sweat when Jay Daniels walked out of the YMCA across the street, recognized him, and asked if hed ever considered coaching. Porter shook his head.But I guess I could, he finally said.Cool, well be here tomorrow, Jay told him. I have a son who plays quarterback.By that point, Jay had pushed his 12-year-old to think about a different position. Jayden was long and lean, always the fastest kid on the field. What about wide receiver? dad would ask. Or cornerback? Jay had played the latter in college, first at Washington, then Iowa State, and to him it was merely a numbers game. Way more opportunities to get on the field, hed argue.The conversation kept coming up. The two kept going back and forth.Dad, Jayden always shot back, Im a quarterback.He was hell-bent, his father says now.So it was settled. Jay wouldnt fight his sons ambitions; hed nurture them.The first thing he did was warn Jayden. Youre gonna have to live in chaos, dad said. If you can live in chaos, then you can do this. Theyd spend hours on YouTube, poring through old games, studying some of the best to ever play the position. Jay wanted his son watching Joe Montana, because Joe Montana never lost his cool. Look at his face, hed tell Jayden. His expression never changes.AdvertisementA hard lesson came early, and it stuck: Jayden was 7, playing defense in the Pop Warner championship, and he was beat around the edge for a touchdown. He looked up at his father, about to burst into tears. Dont cry, Jay pleaded. Its just one play.He knew if the teams best player lost it, everyone else would, too. The tears spilled out. The whole team followed. The game was never close after that, Jay says.That afternoon  and what it taught Jayden  has stayed with him ever since. He built an unflappability into his game, refusing to get rattled. He knows teammates are watching, and teammates will follow.Seven games into his career, Jayden Daniels leads the NFL in completion percentage (75.6) and ranks sixth in passer rating (107.0). (Patrick Smith / Getty Images)Jay had always been a football junkie; his son became one too. Theyd watch college games on Saturdays and the NFL on Sundays. Theyd watch day after day of the scouting combine, then the entire NFL Draft. Porter, who would work with Jayden through high school, learned something early on: this wasnt just a hobby, and it wasnt just a sport.I call it an unhealthy obsession, the coach says. Not one time did Jayden ask, Hey, are my two hours up? He was there to get better. He was never bored. He was just in love with this thing called quarterback.Jay would send over videos from Jaydens U-14 games. OK, we got the zone read and RPO bubble down, hed write. Whats next? Porter realized he could teach Jayden a drill and never have to repeat himself. Hed see a nod, hear Mmmhmmm and nothing more.During workouts, Porter worked the feet more than he worked the arm. The smooth dropbacks Jayden employs now in burgundy and gold  the big five, rhythm five, flash give, seven step, one-step bounce  were first honed on that empty field across from the San Bernardino YMCA. Jayden saw progress through thousands of reps.Your eyes control your feet, and your feet control your arm, Porter kept telling him. He never once tinkered with Jaydens mechanics. He saw no need. Its like a slingshot, Porter says. Throwing a football for somebody like Jayden Daniels is a very natural thing. The minute I make it unnatural, Ive failed him as a coach.AdvertisementJaydens talents blossomed at Cajon High in San Bernardino, where his parents had to sign a waiver to allow him to play varsity as a freshman. He was maybe 130 pounds, Jay says. The Cowboys were state champs three years later. From there the spotlight began to swell, just as Jay had warned, and Jayden wrestled with the rigors of being a star quarterback. The pressure mounted his senior year: Everyone wanted five touchdowns a game, another state title, and, most of all, his college decision.Jay saw it on his sons face at halftime of Cajons playoff opener that fall. Jayden was playing lousy. He looked overwhelmed. Walking into the locker room, coaches kept pulling him aside, pointing out mistakes. The weight of it all, the hype, the expectations  he was a 17-year-old kid shouldering too much.Say something to him, Jay told Porter, who by that point was an assistant at Cajon.So while Jayden warmed up before the third quarter, Porter pulled out his phone and showed him a picture. In it, Jayden was 12 years old, smiling ear to ear, doing his favorite thing in the world: playing football. Forget all this BS right now, Porter told him. I just need you to be this kid.While Jayden stared at the photo, a tear trickled down his cheek. He threw three touchdowns after halftime. Cajon won 39-7 and made its way back to the state title game.While he weighed where to transfer after three years at Arizona State, Jayden Daniels told his dad, If I cant make it at LSU, then I dont deserve to be in the NFL one day. (Scott Winters / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Three years later, another decision beckoned: after a sterling start at Arizona State, Daniels struggled as a junior, tossing as many interceptions (10) as touchdowns. What few knew at the time: how much heartache hed been forced to bottle up inside.The winter before, in a span of three weeks, he lost two grandparents to COVID-19. His grandfathers passing hit hardest: Jays dad had passed football down to him, and Jay had passed it down to Jayden. Jayden and his grandfather had spoken the night before. I love you, his grandpa told him. Itd be the last thing Jayden ever heard him say.AdvertisementMan, that took a toll on both of us, his father says now. He carried a heavy load that season.Meanwhile, the NCAA was digging into ASUs program for alleged recruiting violations. Herm Edwards, the former NFL coach Daniels had come to Tempe to play for, was on his way out. The quarterback sought a bigger stage to finish his college career and an offense better suited to his strengths. He decided to transfer. His phone started blowing up.Daniels decided he wouldnt demand the starting job at his next stop, and his top choice, LSU, wasnt offering it. Hed arrive as the fourth QB on the depth chart.Jay stepped aside and let his son make the decision.High risk, high reward, Jayden told him. If I cant make it at LSU, then I dont deserve to be in the NFL one day.Youre gonna hate me, Sherman Wilson texted him.It was December 2022. Daniels had decided to return to LSU for his fifth and final college season, and Wilson, the Tigers director of player retention, wanted him to know what the next few months were going to look like.Wilson had been goading the quarterback for weeks while he weighed entering the draft. If you wanna be a fourth-round pick, fine, Wilson wrote at one point. But you have more to do here.Once Daniels decided to stay, Wilson became his corner man, Bundini Brown in his ear. Instead of shouting at him ringside, Wilson texted incessantly. Bible verses. Motivational stories. Barbs to seep under Daniels skin. Wilson knew he hadnt come close to reaching his potential in Baton Rouge.You succeed in September by preparing in January, Wilson wrote.Dont act like you wanna be the best if youre not willing to do what others arent.I hope youre ready, because youre not gonna see your family after spring break.For Daniels, everything changed. Hed think like a pro, study like a pro, work like a pro. The first thing he did was sit down with LSUs coaching staff and tick through a series of questions he wanted answered. Among them: Whats the detailed plan of how were going to win a national championship? And: What do I need to do to turn myself into a first-round pick?AdvertisementThe coaches looked around the room. They already had Daniels next few months mapped out, but for the quarterback to show this type of initiative? They knew what was coming. They knew he was about to take over.He put everything into that offseason, says Joe Sloan, LSUs QB coach at the time.A nutritionist cooked Daniels meals and helped him pack on 15 pounds. He started nightly throwing sessions with his top two receivers, Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr., that would last until 10 p.m. In the mornings, Daniels and Wilson would race to the building for 5 a.m. film sessions. Eventually, the quarterback started showing up so early they had to change the keycodes on the door.By the fall he was the best player in college football.Then, one night in November, his season nearly slipped away. A nasty hit knocked Daniels out of the Tigers road loss to Alabama. Im shaking it off! he shouted at Wilson in the medical tent. I gotta finish this! But the staff wouldnt let him. One play, and one concussion, threatened to upend his pursuit of the Heisman Trophy.He texted Wilson around 4 a.m. Theyll probably give it to him, Daniels wrote, referring to Washington QB Michael Penix Jr., Daniels chief competition for the award.Sounds like youre quitting, Wilson wrote back, tapping into Daniels competitive juices.Im not quitting. Just stating the obvious.If youre gonna pack it in, fine.F that, Daniels wrote.The two were in the film room at 5 a.m. on Monday. This is the week thatll define your career, Wilson told him.Daniels couldnt drive, so Wilson picked him up. Daniels was still in concussion protocol, so Wilson used his own fingerprint to get them in the building. The QB watched film of Floridas defense with sunglasses on, his hoodie pulled tight and the door shut. Nobody knew we were there, Wilson says. Daniels barely practiced that week but cleared protocol in time to start.Turns out, the Heisman race wasnt over. Daniels lit up the Gators for 606 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns in a 53-35 rout. A month later he stood on stage in New York City, trophy in hand.Daniels thought his chance at the Heisman disappeared after he was knocked out of a loss to Alabama late in the season. (Rich Graessle / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)On draft night four months later, Daniels waited one pick to hear his name called. Hed been No. 1 on Washingtons board all along, ahead of Caleb Williams, who went first to the Bears. You put in all the work in the early mornings, the late nights, Peters told him over the phone. I couldnt be more proud to pick you to represent our franchise.AdvertisementThen Peters handed the phone over to Dan Quinn. The coach was more direct: Were gonna kick a lot of ass together.Wilson texted a few days later, wanting Daniels thoughts on his new team.Were going to the playoffs, Daniels wrote back.Wilson shook his head  the kid was nothing if not ambitious. But this wasnt college football. The rookie needed to temper his expectations. Brother, this is the NFL, Wilson wrote. This is different.Daniels wouldnt budge.No, listen to me, he replied. Were going to the playoffs.They meet at 9 a.m. every Saturday, an hour before the rest of the team has to be in the building. Inside the room, its just the quarterbacks and skill position players. The 23-year-old rookie stands at the front, running through the 10 or 12 scripted plays the offense plans to open the game with a day later. Daniels reminds them of the audibles he can check into and the coverage beaters hell be looking for.Weve never had meetings like that here, McLaurin says. Not since Ive been here.Kliff Kingsbury, Washingtons first-year offensive coordinator, designed his system around Daniels dual-threat ability  The way he runs, it takes the soul of your defense, Peters gushed on draft night  without putting too much on the rookies shoulders. A heavy dose of short, timing-based throws are mixed in with a stout run game and the occasional deep shot, a healthy balance the young passer can manage. Seven games in, the Commanders are third in scoring (30.1 points per game) and Daniels leads the league in completion percentage (75.6).Marcus Mariota, Daniels backup, says the discipline of his decision-making is rare for a rookie, especially one drafted this high. There are certain expectations that greet a first-round quarterback the minute he walks through the door, expectations Mariota  the No. 2 pick in 2015  knows well. Too many chase highlight plays, Mariota says, the ones they built their name on in college.AdvertisementSo many times young guys in this league are trying to impress people, he says. They wanna extend plays and live up to their draft spot. Jaydens very much, Ill take what you give me. And if you give me the big one, Ill take that, too.'Sloan, now LSUs offensive coordinator, has followed Daniels rookie season closely. Nothings surprised him. He cant help but laugh when he thinks back to the question he kept getting from NFL evaluators last spring. They all wanted to know if Jayden Daniels was ready to be a pro.Listen, Sloan kept telling them, hes already a pro.(Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images)",

Before practice, during training camp and in the halftime locker room, they are a favorite of players across the NFL, a touch of childhood wrapped in plastic.A few years ago The Athletic wrote about orange slices, the NFLs secret halftime snack (fun fact: teams are required to provide three dozen sliced oranges for halftime for the visiting team). But in the course of reporting that story, many players said they passed on halftime citrus in favor of something else: Uncrustables, the sealed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches found in the frozen aisle of your local supermarket  and apparently permeating the NFL.AdvertisementAt the end of the 2023 season, The Athletic endeavored to find out just how many Uncrustables the league actually eats. And after convincing team employees that this was in fact a real question and not another scam message, most teams agreed to pony up their data from last year. A handful declined to participate, and a few others said they were PB&J purists who made their own sandwiches.But based on the information collected, its safe to say that NFL teams go through anywhere from 3,600 to 4,300 Uncrustables a week. When you factor in training camps and the teams that did not share their data, NFL teams easily go through at least 80,000 Uncrustables a year.Weekly Uncrustable consumption across the NFL DEN 700 SEA 320 JAX 315 MIA 300 ATL 250 NYG 240 PIT 225 ARI 200 MIN 200 LAC 200 BAL 150 WAS 140 CLE 120 CAR 100 TEN 100 CHI 100 IND 90 LAR 90 KC 80 DAL 75 TB 70 LV 60 CIN 50 NO 50 Note: 24 of 32 NFL teams provided The Athletic with approximate ranges for weekly Uncrustables eaten.

Sometime in the mid-90s, Len said, his wife, Emily, suggested he create a mass-produced peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the crust.The project appealed to Lens business instinct: a simple idea with a complex logistical problem to solve. The Kretchmans started in their kitchen with a loaf of bread, one jar of peanut butter, one jar of jelly and a few drinks.Were not recreating the atomic bomb here, Len said. Were trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  It was two people standing there, goofing off, probably having a beer and a glass of wine and saying, What do you think of this?'The first decision they made was that the sandwich should be round.The moon is round, the sun is round, the Earth is round, its our favorite shape, Len said. Do you have to go to a committee and survey people on what the shape should be? No. Its round. So we got that nailed down.Secrets behind the NFLs favorite sandwich Kitchen-counter to mass production Founder Len Kretchmans wife, Emily, suggested commercializing the snack, which got its iconic round shape from initially being cut out using a drinking glass. Innovative technique Putting the jelly in the middle and covering it with the peanut butter turned out to be the key to protecting the jelly from leaking. Whats in a name? The original name of the product, The Incredible Uncrustable, was coined by an 11-year-old boy whose father was involved in the business.Next, he grabbed a cup from his kitchen cabinet.If you asked moms how they (took the crust off a sandwich) 30 years ago, theyd say: I found a glass in my cupboard that was the right dimension and I pressed on the bread and I cut the crust off,' Kretchman said. And thats what we did!They added a crimp to the edges of the crustless bread, which was easy, but then had to figure out how to keep the jelly from oozing, which was not. Every time they thawed their creations, the jelly bled into the bread and ruined the sandwich. Much trial and error followed.We finally put the blob of jelly in the middle of the bread and then covered it with peanut butter and encased the jelly so it doesnt leach into the bread, Kretchman said. That was key. That was our gee-whiz moment.Were not recreating the atomic bomb here... were trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Len Kretchman, Co-inventor of UncrustablesKretchman and his business partner, David Geske, pitched their product to local schools. They needed a name. Once again, the idea landed in their kitchen. They asked the 11-year-old son of a business associate for a suggestion. His answer: The Incredible Uncrustable. Four years later, in 1999, Smuckers bought the company, dropped the first part of the name and introduced the country to the Uncrustable.It took a little time, but the NFL wasnt far behind.The Uncrustables eaten by the NFL in one year would cover over 18 yards of a football fieldThey werent there when former Pro Bowl tight end Dallas Clark was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in 2003. Of that much hes certain. But the moment this new treat joined the food ranks with all that other healthy crap the Colts provided? He cant really say.All that he remembers is the feeling that something beautiful had happened.AdvertisementIts up there with the cell phone where youre like, How is this done?' Clark said. When they came out it was like, Duh, why did someone not think of this a looong time ago?'It was Jon Torines job to stock those snacks, healthy crap and all, for the Colts. And it was an especially important job during the week of the Super Bowl in 2007 when the Colts played the Chicago Bears in Miami. In the hotel ballroom where the team stayed, Torine, the Colts strength and conditioning coach at the time, laid out a spread for players to grab and go as they moved from meeting to meeting.You could throw your playbook on top of em, didnt make any difference. Squished, unsquished, youre gonna crush it. Jeff Saturday, former Colts centerWe were all scoopin and scorin, said Jeff Saturday, a center on that team. We were grabbing five, six at a time.Clark, a player who struggled to keep on weight, would throw them in his backpack, unbothered by what would happen to them once there. The Uncrustables always found their way to the bottom and got smashed by the playbook, he said. But still edible. Still in one compartment.Didnt matter, Saturday said. You could throw your playbook on top of em, didnt make any difference. Squished, unsquished, youre gonna crush it.They are now a staple for many NFL teams. San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle eats two on flights to road games and anywhere from two to four on flights home. Chiefs defensive end Mike Danna eats them at the team facility and at home. Ravens kicker Justin Tucker grabs one from the snack table on his way to meetings. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce claimed on his podcast that he eats more of them than anything else in the world.Were all creatures of habit, dude, Saturday said. Almost freakishly. If youre a two-Uncrustables-a-day kind of guy, thats just what you do.Each week, the NFL consumes nearly the weight of three Travis Kelces in UncrustablesTorine and most nutritionists wouldnt recommend frozen, processed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as their No. 1 healthy snack option for players. But Uncrustables can do the job, especially when time is limited, and even nutritionists at the highest level of sports performance make compromises.AdvertisementThe bread and jelly give players quick carbohydrates. The peanut butter provides a little fat and a little protein. Theyre easy to digest, convenient to eat and a comfort food that players love (though there is wide disagreement as to whether grape or strawberry is the better jelly flavor  the correct answer is strawberry).In fact, the Colts also ate Uncrustables at halftime of Super Bowl XLI, when they beat the Bears 29-17.So maybe that was the difference, Torine said, laughing.",

            "text": "Sue Altman speaking with voters after a candidate forum held by Jewish organizations in New Jersey. A Democrat, she is running against Representative Thomas Kean Jr., a first-term Republican.Sue Altman has made a name for herself by taking on political heavy hitters in New Jersey.First was Chris Christie, the famously pugnacious Republican governor, who, during a 2016 town hall, was so exasperated by her questions about education funding that he tossed his microphone to her.Three years later, she tangled with George Norcross III, then among the states most influential Democratic power brokers, as she led a drumbeat of criticism against corporate tax breaks awarded to companies with close ties to him.Now Ms. Altman is seeking to unseat Thomas Kean Jr., a first-term Republican congressman who is the scion and namesake of a former governor, in one of a handful of races nationwide that will determine whether Republicans retain control of the House.The result of Tuesdays election in New Jerseys Seventh Congressional District may say a lot about how Mr. Kean, 56, has campaigned in the race, where recent polls have prompted Democrats to mount a last-minute push in hopes of flipping the seat.Image Mr. Kean, a son of a former Republican governor, was elected to the House two years ago. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York TimesBut it also may offer insight into the direction of New Jersey and of suburban swing districts like the Seventh, an affluent and well-educated region split nearly evenly between Republicans and Democrats. President Biden beat Donald J. Trump there by four points in 2020, but two years later Mr. Kean beat the Democratic incumbent, Tom Malinowski, by about three points.Ben Dworkin, director of Rowan Universitys Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship, said he saw the election mainly as a referendum on the hold that Mr. Trump has on the moderate wing of the Republican Party.If Democrats are able to win in NJ-7, Professor Dworkin said, then it will really show the negative impact that Donald Trump had on Republican candidates down ballot.Republican PACs have poured millions of dollars into the race. Voters in some parts of the North Jersey district, which stretches from the states border with Pennsylvania through quaint towns filled with horse farms to the eastern cities of Rahway and Linden, say their mailboxes fill regularly with Kean campaign literature.According to polls, Mr. Kean is ahead by about two points against Ms. Altman, a former teacher and professional basketball player who until last year ran the Working Families alliance, a left-leaning political organizing group.The campaign arm of House Democrats committed to spending about $4 million just last week  its first financial commitment in the race  after surveys showed that the contest was narrowing. Democratic Party luminaries like Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a leader of the congressional progressive PAC, and Bill Bradley, a former U.S. senator and New York Knicks star, have joined Ms. Altman, 42, on the campaign trail.At a candidate forum last week, the races high stakes and the potency of abortion rights as a political issue were on display.Mr. Kean described Ms. Altmans support for abortion access as abortion on demand, the same terminology he used two years ago in his successful campaign against Mr. Malinowski.Ms. Altman supports abortion access and a New Jersey law that codified the right to the procedure throughout a pregnancy.Mr. Kean, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, describes himself as pro-choice and said he would oppose a national ban on abortion. But he has also said that abortion policy was best handled at the state level when asked about the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which ended a constitutional right to abortion.During the forum, Mr. Kean, who opposed funding for Planned Parenthood while in the State Legislature, twice referred to doctors who commit abortion. When asked about the phrasing, which could be interpreted as condemning doctors who perform abortions, he said he had misspoken.Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by 917,000 voters.But that is not the case in the Seventh Congressional District, where the G.O.P. has more support and people who are not registered with either major party represent the largest bloc of voters. The district is filled with fiscally conservative residents who also support moderate social policies and who helped to propel Republicans like Mr. Christie; Mr. Keans father, Gov. Thomas Kean Sr.; and Christine Todd Whitman to the states highest office.A Monmouth University poll that put Mr. Kean ahead by two percentage points also found that more voters trusted him to handle issues related to the economy and crime. That edge was dwarfed, however, by Ms. Altmans advantage when voters were asked about abortion and reproductive health policy.Mr. Kean and his campaign have emphasized the brand of liberal politics that Ms. Altman stood for while leading Working Families, one of the states most progressive organizations. He has also highlighted a comment she made in 2020 on social media that referred to those of us working on #DefundThePolice in Jersey.She has apologized for that sentiment and disavowed it, saying she has since gained a better understanding of policing from officers and family members who worked for police agencies.But it is an issue that has resonated. At a town-hall meeting Ms. Altman held in Phillipsburg, on the states western flank, a member of the audience, Vinny Panico, challenged her position on policing.We have people breaking into houses, rummaging through peoples personal belongings to find their car keys to steal their cars, Mr. Panico, 33, a Republican, said in a subsequent interview, referring to a yearslong uptick in car thefts. Our police departments, and our men and women in blue, and our justice system, need support.Like Mr. Kean, Ms. Altman has worked to appeal to centrist voters, or, as she describes them, moderate people who are witnessing their beloved Republican Party dwindling down to this extremist morass.She grew up in the district, regularly mentions that her parents are Republicans, and in stump speeches stresses her background as an anti-corruption advocate with a record of opposing Democratic as well as Republican leaders.Both candidates are highly educated and each has raised more than $5 million in campaign contributions. Ms. Altman has two masters degrees from Oxford; Mr. Kean has a masters from Tufts and completed his doctoral studies there.But the comparisons end there.Mr. Kean is an awkward public speaker, holds few events open broadly to the public and avoids most media requests for interviews.Ms. Altmans energy and candor are among the first things people note after listening to her speak.To me, shes like a breath of fresh air, Melissa Lipman, 78, a Democrat, said after an event last week.",

            "text": "What does it really mean to live in a country where abortion is no longer a constitutional right? Since 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, many states have made it all but impossible to get abortion care within their borders, and have done their best to isolate people facing unwanted or complicated pregnancies, making them afraid to reach out to medical providers or even to friends and loved ones who might help them. New laws have forced doctors to delay care in life-threatening situations and made women afraid to seek it, leading to preventable deaths. Did anyone really want this?Even when the consequences havent been that dire, the day-to-day reality of abortion in Americas left-behind places now involves navigating constant undercurrents of confusion and fear: Is this pill I found on the internet safe? If I miscarry, is anyone going to help me? Or, in the cases of some doctors: How can I help this patient without getting arrested?We asked people at the front lines of abortion access to help us understand how the new laws have filtered into their worlds. They answered our call with texts, audio messages, videos and pictures; some shared their stories anonymously out of fear of reprisal. Taken as a whole, their dispatches show us an untenable status quo, held together by sheer grit and determination. But for how much longer?This presidential election will be the first since the Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, when voters will be presented with a choice: to try to rein in the chaos unleashed by the ruling or to live in a country that continues to be shaped by it.",

            "text": "As the votes were counted on election night 2016, the first big sign of trouble for Hillary Clinton came from Michigan, arguably the most Democratic of the presidential swing states. In 2020, Joe Biden flipped it back to the Democrats. Now, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump appear to be in a dead heat in Michigan, and its once again crucial for winning the presidency. For our latest Times Opinion focus group, we gathered a cross-section of Michigan voters to assess the race in the home stretch.The takeaway isnt especially positive for Ms. Harris.Our five independents, four Democrats and two Republicans were clear on a few points: Most want significant change in America under the next president, and the bulk of them cite the economy as their top issue and care more about the candidates policies than their values. One voter was troubled by Ms. Harriss support for arms to Israel and is leaning toward Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Others thought Mr. Trump didnt understand what it meant to struggle financially.Perhaps most worrisome for Ms. Harris, nine of our 11 participants thought she would pursue policies similar to Mr. Bidens. Muhammad, a 25-year-old software engineer and registered independent who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020, said he was struck by a recent TV ad showing Ms. Harris on The View saying she could not think of a thing she would have done differently from Mr. Biden during their administration. For him and others, Harris's problems boil down to two words: \"Change\" and \"Biden.\"I understand not pushing Biden under the bus, but she needs to be more authentic and actually take responsibility for the failures of her administration. She was the border czar, and that is a failure. All she needed to do was be authentic about that, Muhammad said.Some participants were enthusiastic about Ms. Harriss energy and ideas and thought that as a woman, she represented change. But as for who will win Michigan and the presidency, these voters thought the race was trending toward Trump, even though several of them saw him as dangerous and unhinged.",

Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Over the next few days at the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris will accept her partys nomination and reintroduce herself to American voters. Today, my colleague, Astead Herndon, looks at the key periods in Harriss life that explain who she is, what she believes, and the kind of president she might become. Its Monday, August 19. Astead, thank you for coming in here.astead herndonThank you for having me. Im happy to be here.michael barbaroThe strange thing about this election  I mean, there are a lot of strange things about this election.astead herndonIm like, one?michael barbaroOne of the strange things about this election is that we have a Democratic nominee who has been the nominee for, what, four weeks? And did not go through the yearlong public dissection that generally occurs when you run for president and makes everybody very familiar with your life story by the time you become the nominee. And we actually keep hearing that when we go out and report about Harris. A lot of people, theyre interested in her, but they dont really know who she is. And thats why we want to talk to you. We want to tell the story of Kamala Harris in as full a way as possible. And you have spent the past couple of years doing that, not knowing that we would arrive at this moment, but just because it was a story that you got really interested in. How do you think about the life story of Kamala Harris?astead herndonYeah. I think there is often an incentive to try to get an easy answer to who is Kamala Harris or what does she believe in. And the thing that I have learned in covering her over this time is that you should resist that desire, that theres not really an easy answer. And the boxes that folks try to put her in, whether it be about identity or about comparison to past politicians, namely Barack Obama, I dont think are really that helpful in terms of understanding someone whose life and track to this point has been really singular.michael barbaroEmbracing that thesis that this is a singular person whos resistant to easy labels, where do you think we should start to try to understand who she really is? Whats the first chapter of this singular story of Kamala Harris?astead herndonI would start in her growing up. She grows up in Oakland in the backdrop of the 1960s Bay Area, and is really shaped by her family and community thats around her. Her mother was a scientist at the University of California Berkeley, and an immigrant from India who came here to learn at the school and meets her father, who is also an academic there and is a Jamaican immigrant. And importantly, theyre activists who were, like many people in that time, active in the Civil Rights Movement. And she tells stories when shes on the trail about going to marches and rallies from times of being in a stroller. I would also say that the multiculturalness and specifically the racial identity of the place she grows up really matters. This is someone who is growing up really around not only just a Black community, but a very prideful, rich history of Blackness.michael barbaroExplain that.astead herndonThe Black Panthers headquarters was blocks from her house. And her parents did a very intentional effort to place their children in Black affirmation spaces. They would go to these classes on the weekends where kids from the community would come and have these Black history lessons. It was called The Cactus Club. And the reason it was called The Cactus Club is because it was about Black people being able to grow in any environment.michael barbaroJust like a cactus.astead herndonYeah. And that lives alongside her also having a really comfortable relationship with the Indian side of her family. I mean, she would travel to India. Her parents family were folks who were fighting for democracy and their independence movements. She would have those conversations with her grandfather. I mean, so it wasnt someone who I think was really only defined by one thing. But it was very much taught from an early age that you exist, Im using a coconut reference, but you exist in the context of both of those things. And so that was very much an intentional effort from her mother. And by the time shes in elementary school, she finds herself as a part of a group of students who are involved in a desegregation program that buses them to a different part of town. Theyre actually the second class of Black Berkeley to be shipped.michael barbaroBig deal.astead herndonYeah. And its something that really shapes her growing up. I talked to one of her friends from growing up. Her name is Cynthia Bagby, who mentioned remembering when her and Kamala Harris, first grade, were at the bus stop being ready to be bused to a different part of town. And Cynthia told me this story about how nervous she was, about how she didnt have white friends and she knew that they were being put in a different situation and environment.michael barbaroTheyre plunged in a completely alien place.astead herndonAbsolutely. But what Cynthia told me was that she remembers a young Kamala Harris being so confident and being so unfazed by this situation that when they got back from school, she noticed how Kamala had already 10 friends, was kind of socially running the place. Everyone loved her after the first day.michael barbaroThe mayor of the new largely white school.astead herndonYeah. And so those were the type of stories that people would tell that not only was there a confidence that flowed, but there was a comfort with herself and her identity that really attracted people to her.michael barbaroAnd that comfort youre describing seems like it would flow pretty directly from the way her parents raised her, the classes they brought her to, and that this is an extremely self-possessed person who knows her spot in the world.astead herndonAbsolutely. I remember asking her once, where did this come from, youre self-belief? And I remember her saying, I was raised to believe that I belong in every room that I am in. And that is the core of Kamala Harriss self-belief. It does not come from the position she has now. It does not come from status gained later in life. It comes from an instilling of confidence and pride that started from the day she was born. And so by the time that Kamala Harris is in high school, she knows that she wants to go to an HBCU to follow in the footsteps not only of people around her, but of historical figures who she admired, like the Thurgood Marshalls of the world. And I think thats an important choice.michael barbaroWhy?astead herndonBecause youre achieving young people of color, theres sometimes an incentive to follow the White institutional elites to X place, go to an Ivy League, go to this or that. A 15-16-year-old with the world in front of them saying, I want to put myself at Howard University isnt a small choice. It is a recognition of who the communities are that matter to them and their belief that Black folks can shape them to be excellent, period.michael barbaroHow does the next chapter of her life, her chosen career as a prosecutor, how does that flow from everything that youre just describing? All this pride in being a member of the Black community. Because in my, perhaps, naive mind, being in law enforcement in the period when shes coming out of Howard, seems like it might be in conflict with being a proud member of a Black community that American law enforcement is increasingly seen as having a very adversarial relationship with.astead herndonYeah, I think this comes up all the time. And to be clear, it came up when she was growing up. I mean, when I talk to people from Oakland, they say that when young Kamala Harris, theyre shining community star, decided to become a prosecutor, it was a topic of conversation among her family and friends. Like, what you doing, sis?michael barbaroAnd what was her answer?astead herndonShes talked about this a lot in speeches and interviews, and taken people through how she thinks about this decision.archived recording (kamala harris) When it came time to make my career choice, my family gathered around. And they said, Kamala, what are you going to do in your fight for justice? And I got all excited. And I said, Ive decided Im going to be a prosecutor. If you have any sense of who my family is, you will know that at best they found it a curious decision. And with some of them, I had to defend the decision like one would a thesis.astead herndonShe knew she was making a controversial choice.archived recording (kamala harris) I believe safety is a civil right. A civil right to which all people are entitled. And lets talk about a myth, a myth that Black people dont want public safety. That is simply not true.astead herndonAnd part of the reason she gives is that minority communities and specifically Black people deserve safety.archived recording (kamala harris) And I said, why is it that we should only be on the outside of systems? Isnt there a role also for us to play on being on the inside, where the decisions are being made?astead herndonAnd to go back to context, I think its important to recognize this is the 1980s. This is a generation of Black people that are coming after the Civil Rights Movement that have access to institutions and halls of power for the first time. And for a lot of those people, there was a real ethos of, you need to do something with that. You need to wield these instruments of power to be more responsive to Black communities. You could enter those halls and make them things that worked for Black people.michael barbaroWhat does it look like once she gets inside these halls of power, actually becomes a prosecutor? How does she put this philosophy about representation and change into practice?astead herndonShe runs for district attorney in San Francisco. And she, frankly, makes her whole public pitch around this idea that its not empathetic to say, dont lock anybody up. And so thats how she wins that first race. But she also does it, I think, through representing a vision of the future rather than past. Her identity is laced into that argument. The fact that shes young, the fact that shes a person of color, the fact that she is a woman are all things that really matter. It is not about the identity, but that has always been an implicit part of the pitch. She was making an argument that was about the policy.michael barbaroNot about her identity, but her identity obviously came with the package of her as a candidate.astead herndonYes, comes with the package of the candidate and is part of the reason that shes arguing that these institutions can do something different is because I represent something different. And once she wins office, what it looks like for her to put this into practice is a set of policies that I think really add up to the earliest versions of what we now call a Progressive prosecutor. She says that you can be focused on delivering safety and accountability while you also look at root causes or try to be empathetic to people, in a way that separates herself from what, I would describe, as the crime bill, Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, 1990s view of the world.michael barbaroWhats a good example of this?astead herndonOne example I would say is the Back On Track Program that she started. That was one of the first to allow formerly incarcerated felons to find their way back into the workforce. Shes really proud of that. Thats obviously been something thats been taken nationally at this point. I think its just the thing that people agree on should happen.michael barbaroThat there needs to be a bridge between prison and the rest of your life.astead herndonBut that, at the time, was kind of spicy. And thats one of the things that she piloted. The other thing I would say and the thing that blew up is what she was doing around the idea of truancy or the chronic absence of children in schools. One of the things that happened in the time when she was prosecutor was there were some data that came out that showed that people who are incarcerated usually missed a bunch of school in their time of growing up, that early absences in childhood were indicative of someone who might have future criminal justice problems. And so there was a question of what to do about that.archived recording 1 Joining us to explain how truancy impacts the entire family is San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris. It is great to have you with us.astead herndonAnd from a prosecutors vantage point, she actually tried to take this problem on.archived recording (kamala harris) And what weve done is we started an initiative a couple of years ago that involved me assigning prosecutors to go and meet with the teacher when they met with the parent. And so the prosecutors there and the parent says, whos that mean looking person? And they say, thats the prosecutor, because if we cant fix this problem, they may end up prosecuting you. But by the way, the way we want to fix the problem is weve got all these services for you.astead herndonShe used her role to Institute a series of policies that would hold the parents accountable for chronically absent children.archived recording (kamala harris) And its been fantastic, because when the principal would otherwise call the parent and say, Miss Smith, Johnnys not in class. Would you return my call? Call went unanswered. Now, the principal calls and says, Miss Smith, Johnnys not in class. And by the way, that DA Kamala Harris has said she might prosecute you and send you to jail. And that call gets returned.astead herndonBasically, after a series of warnings, charging the parents if their kids miss enough school under the idea of it would make the kids come more frequently and stop them from getting involved in the criminal justice system kind of before it becomes a big problem. And while that could be good in theory, the reality was that this resulted in a targeting of Black, low income, people of color.michael barbaroThe very people that she thinks of herself as trying to improve the lives of.astead herndonAbsolutely. There were a couple of instances, particularly when the program was adopted by other places, that resulted in parents being perp walked, that resulted in charging certain parents. And I think it had the stench of punitive meanness that was already coming down on people who had a lot of problems.michael barbaroWhat do you make of that?astead herndonTo me, its indicative of a worldview that is reflective of a prosecutor. I think if youre a mayor, a city councilor, Senate, or House, youre used to seeing problems from a 360 lens and you get afforded the space to come up with a vision to solve them. Thats not really what prosecutors do.michael barbaroThey charge or they dont.astead herndonThey react. They hold people accountable. Its about law enforcement. And so this example of truancy is one of the times she tries to take that law enforcement view of the world and apply it to root causes of a problem. And so I think you can see it from a lot of different vantage points. And one way, its a Progressive prosecutor thinking about how can I attack a problem at its root. Thats a really kind of progressive thought. But at the same time, what she did with that was kind of punitive. It was not something that really attacked the full scope and then I think had the impact of, frankly, reinforcing some of the same tropes about these parents and these communities that Im pretty sure she wants to avoid. And I think that shows the limits of that kind of accountability viewpoint.michael barbaroOr perhaps even the contradictions of it. But she seems comfortable with those contradictions. That on some level, yes, shes trying to solve a problem at its root, insofar as shes able to do it. And it might actually result in some parents getting in some real trouble, parents in the Black community shes there to try to protect and improve the lives of, but shes kind of made peace with that.astead herndonI think so to a certain extent. For one, on truancy, she does back off. And so I do think that there were academics and Progressives who reached out to that office to say that you are making a mistake. And some of that eventually landed. But I do think that there is a sense of comfort with the idea that harm creates consequences. And some people are going to get locked up.michael barbaroAnd you might not like me for it.astead herndonAnd you might not like me for it, but I think you like the results of it. And I think her view of the world is accountability can be empathetic. And she rides this approach to the attorney generals office and then eventually to the US Senate. And shes comfortable with that approach. Its when she goes to Washington and eventually runs for president when a lot of this becomes uncomfortable.michael barbaroWell be right back. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Astead, take us into the next chapter of this story here. Kamala Harris as a Democratic candidate for president, when this record of hers as a prosecutor, as you just said, becomes less comfortable for her.astead herndonYeah, I think about the 2016 election. On that night, she was all but guaranteed to be the next senator from California.michael barbaroShe wins the US Senate seat the night of the Clinton versus Trump election?astead herndonYes. And there was a sense among Democrats that not only would Hillary Clinton win, but Clinton would be a transition to a next coming of Democratic stars.michael barbaroBut a few years down the road.astead herndonA few years down the road.michael barbaroBut, of course, thats not how that night goes. Donald Trump wins. And very immediately, Democrats are thrust into this mass resistance where they are searching for someone who can become the face of leading the party out of the rubble. And so she goes from being someone who should have six years to start to understand Washington, to someone who is being floated as a possible 2020 presidential candidate. Its a real sea change in the trajectory that she was supposed to have. And as shes having this open discussion about whats happening next, she has a couple viral moments that make her a celebrity. The Supreme Court confirmation hearings.archived recording (kamala harris) Can you think of any laws give government the power to make decisions about the male body? archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Uh.astead herndonI think Kavanaugh really encapsulated a lot of that.archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Im happy to answer a more specific question. archived recording (kamala harris) Male versus female. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) There are medical procedures.astead herndonThe way she was going at Jeff Sessions and Trump figures of the time.archived recording (kamala harris) Sir, I have just a few  archived recording (jeff sessions) Will you let me qualify it? If I dont qualify it, youll accuse me of lying. I need to be correct as best I can. archived recording (kamala harris) I do want you to be honest. archived recording (jeff sessions) Im not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous.astead herndonAnd she becomes a hero for a lot of these folks and a driver of Democratic fundraising. And so it elevates you from someone who people are talking about in the background to being someone who is seen as a star of the party. And that only furthers the question of running for president. And frankly, I think cements it. And so by the time that she is actually putting her hat in the ring, the campaign comes up with a strategy that I think is reflective of the things we were talking about before. They dont want to choose an ideological lane. They want her to be everything to everyone. And they think that they can do that in this race.michael barbaroAnd be true to herself.astead herndonAnd be true to herself.archived recording (kamala harris) Whats up, Oakland? [LAUGHS]astead herndonAnd I remember the announcement speech she gave in Oakland where there was 20,000 people outside.archived recording (kamala harris) It was just a couple of blocks from this very spot, nearly 30 years ago as a young district attorney, I walked into the courtroom for the first time and said the five words that would guide my lifes work, Kamala Harris for the people.astead herndonAnd she told a very clear story about why she became a prosecutor, about what her vision was going forward.archived recording (kamala harris) I knew our criminal justice system was deeply flawed. But I also knew the profound impact law enforcement has on peoples lives and its responsibility to give them safety and dignity. I knew I wanted to protect people. And I knew that the people in our society who are most often targeted by predators are also most often the voiceless and vulnerable. And on that point, I believed then, as I do now, no one should be left to fight alone. [CHEERING]astead herndonAnd I think was really reflective of the vision of what that campaign thought they could do.michael barbaroAnd the story youve been telling here.astead herndonAnd the story weve been telling here. The problem was thats not how that primary went. It wasnt a primary that was really about working with institutions to make marginal gains.michael barbaroIt was about blowing them up to a degree.astead herndonYeah. And over the next several months archived recording 2 Good evening, Senator. Thank you for being here. You position yourself as aligned with the Progressive movement to make criminal justice less punitive and racist. Yet, your record as a prosecutor shows that you embrace the tough-on-crime mentality.astead herndonAs activists are creating litmus tests about what progressive means, about what constitutes criminal justice reform archived recording 3 Will you support the Bernie Sanders bill, which essentially gets rid of insurance? archived recording (kamala harris) I support Medicare for all, but I really do need to clear up what happened on that stage. It was in the context of saying, lets get rid of all the bureaucracy. Lets get all of the ways  archived recording 3 Not the insurance companies? archived recording (kamala harris) No. Thats not what I meant. I know it was astead herndon forcing her to answer more specific questions about what health care systems should look like and things like that.michael barbaroThis is the year where the moderators are always asking the Democratic candidates on the debate stage to raise their hand if they think that private health insurance should go away.astead herndonYeah.archived recording 4 Youve been asked to clarify this question a couple of times over the course of the campaign. Once and for all, do you believe private insurance should be eliminated in this country? archived recording (kamala harris) No. archived recording 4 You dont? archived recording (kamala harris) No, I do not. archived recording 4 But you raised your hand last night. archived recording (kamala harris) The question was, would you give up your private insurance for that option? And I said, yes. archived recording 4 I think you heard it differently than others then. archived recording (kamala harris) Probably, because thats what I heard.astead herndonAnd the primary became more and more about structural change and about how you articulate policy visions. She fell further and further behind, partly because thats not how she functions. And so at the time and when she was supposed to introduce herself to the country, I think the campaign was telling a fairly inconsistent story about who she was personally and who she was ideologically, and people werent really responding to that. And that feeling ends up overtaking the campaign.archived recording 5 We are confirming that Senator Kamala Harris plans to drop out of the 2020 presidential race. archived recording 6 Miss Harris entered the race as a major force on the campaign trail. You recall she had a huge crowd in Oakland. But she failed to capitalize on that early enthusiasm and plummeted in the polls. [UPBEAT MUSIC]michael barbaroThat race and the way youre describing it, Astead, makes me want to understand what happened to that self-confident person who doesnt want to check the boxes and knows who she is, and says, accept me on my own terms. Obviously, one of the answers are the debate stages and the litmus tests you just mentioned. But we all know what happened in that race. The person who won the Democratic primary astead herndonWas the person who flipped all those tests off.michael barbaroAnd the person who sounded the most like Kamala Harris, Joe Biden. Equally associated with moderate politics, law and order, defending the police, and working within the system. She could have done what he did.astead herndonAbsolutely. It wasnt as if those positions were incompatible with the Democratic electorate. But what Joe Biden was willing to do in that primary that Kamala Harris wasnt was tell those Progressive groups to  they flipped them off. He told them, I dont care what your litmus tests are. This is who I am. Youre going to take this experience. And most importantly, Joe Biden was telling a consistent story about electability. I can beat Trump, and thats what you need to focus on. That was not where other people were. And most importantly, Harris was pulled away from what I think that self-confidence was.michael barbaroIt goes back to this idea perhaps that this just happened too fast. She wasnt ready.astead herndonI think so. When youre a journalist asking Bernie, Biden, even Warren, a question, theyve spent so much time thinking about running for president and their worldview, they return to a core belief. They return back to a basic, fundamental understanding they have about why problems are the way that they are. And no matter what question you ask, even if they dont fully know, theyre going to return back to that core. What was missing from Harris, in my opinion of 2020, was that sense of core. And so when she was asked questions on arenas she was uncomfortable in, you could feel her swimming for an answer. And I think that read as inauthentic. And particularly when youre not a figure that people already know. And so in her moment of introducing herself to the country, she was the most distant from the person shes always been. And I think that gap is what doomed that campaign.michael barbaroAnd then, of course, out of the ashes of this pretty abject failure of a campaign comes the vice presidency.astead herndonYeah. And I think its important to remember how she drops out in a way that I think was really sudden for people. And almost immediately, you saw the tide of sympathy turn in the Democratic Party.michael barbaroToward her?astead herndonToward her.michael barbaroFascinating.astead herndonPeople saying, maybe we were too hard on her. And that started immediately. And so by the time Joe Biden becomes someone whos looking for a VP and then, importantly, makes a pledge to choose a woman in that summer, a lot changes between the time that Biden becomes the nominee and the time in which hes selecting a VP. You have not only the onset of the pandemic and the shutdown of the country, but you also have the explosion of the racial justice protests that happened after George Floyds murder. And so the conversation around Bidens VP selection gets wrapped up in both of those facts. And you have a pretty open debate among the party about whether he has to choose a Black woman.michael barbaroNow theres pressure not just to choose a woman, but to choose a Black woman.astead herndonAnd so I think there was a feeling that if you did not choose Kamala Harris, you were skipping over the most qualified Black woman. And so the campaign chooses Harris. And I think its important to remember it was their best fundraising day that they had all year when they chose Harris.michael barbaroBut the result of this, and I want you to correct me if Im in any way wrong about this, is that shes being put in something of an identity box. And she doesnt like identity boxes.astead herndonIts true. And I think that she does not like being identity first as the reason shes in the room, even if thats part of her worldview. It is a very understandable feeling to say, I dont want to be here only because Im a Black-South Asian woman, period. And it created a situation where the DEI hire framing that, obviously, Republicans have latched on to, was always in the air with her selection. And I think, frankly, it reflects the thinking of the Biden inner circle at the time, the underestimation they had of both her and I think their misconceptions about the political moment at large.michael barbaroExplain that.astead herndonI think its most clear in the policy portfolios she takes on. She was assigned what, I think, is universally seen as a horrible electoral platform, which is the root causes of migration in certain Central American countries.michael barbaroRight. Its like asking someone to solve the greatest riddle in the last 50 years of American foreign policy.astead herndonTotally.michael barbaroAnd Harris knew this was an electoral loser. She actually asked out of the assignment. [LAUGHS]: Can I have something else, please?astead herndonYeah. And Biden made clear, no, this is what I want you to do. And it has immediate impacts.archived recording (kamala harris) I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border astead herndonThink about the infamous press conference she had with the president of Guatemala talking about immigrants.michael barbaroYep.archived recording (kamala harris)  do not come. Do not come.astead herndonThe interview she had with Lester Holt about whether she went to the border or not. There was an understanding that this was a political loser, but it was something that they tasked her with and that she, frankly, just had to soldier on from. The other thing that happens, and I think this is natural with VP office versus West Wing, was there was a push and pull about which events to use her at, particularly in the first couple of years. And to the point about not being want to be put in a box of race and gender, there was a story I heard about a time in which the West Wing wanted her to be used at this event where there was a baby formula shortage that was national news.michael barbaroTotally.astead herndonAnd the administration was doing some efforts to try to make sure they could get more formula. And there was a plane landing that was filled with formula. And the administration wanted to do a photo op taking credit for solving baby formula crisis. Classic political maneuver. And they asked Harris to go. And, again, to the point about when is identity helpful versus when does it put you in a box? This is something she didnt want to do.michael barbaroBe kind of womaned.astead herndonYeah, be put in that box. And I think it reflects the hard choices that sometimes identity can put you in. And so particularly in those first couple of years, that was a push and pull between her and White House. But she largely takes on the assignments that the White House gives her. And most importantly, she maintains an intense sense of loyalty to President Biden that he really appreciates. And so it matters to him that she says, yes, when he reassigns her that immigration assignment, and that she goes to Guatemala, and she does those things right.michael barbaroShe does almost all the things.astead herndonShe does the things that are required of her. The impact is that for the first couple of years of her as VP, shes still dealing with some of the clouds that hung over her during the presidential race. There is a sense that you dont really know what shes doing or what she believes in. But I think that really starts to change around 2022.archived recording (kamala harris) This is the first time in the history of our nation that a constitutional right has been taken from the people of America.astead herndonAfter the Dobbs decision, it creates a lane for her in the administration that she really latches on to.archived recording (kamala harris) I do know that the American people fight for freedom and believe in the womans right to make decisions about her own body.astead herndonAnd she becomes the spokesperson for the administration on the issue and becomes the liaison between abortion rights groups and the White House.archived recording (kamala harris) What has happened here in Arizona is a new inflection point. It has demonstrated once and for all that overturning Roe was just the opening act, just the opening act of a larger strategy to take womens rights and freedoms.astead herndonShe starts embracing the language of freedoms and Democrats protecting reproductive rights.archived recording (kamala harris) And now, because of Donald Trump, more than 20 states in our nation have bans. Now, because of Donald Trump, one in three women of reproductive age in our country live in a state that has a Trump abortion ban.astead herndonThe stump speech was better. It just clarified her pitch because she can go back to something that a lot of people really care about and, most importantly, is at the top of Democrats list. And so I think the first couple of years are education in Washington that may not have happened before she was running for president. But what happened after that was she traveled across the country and, I think, took on a lot of the campaigning efforts that Biden was not doing. And so as a result, she became someone who was more comfortable doing those interactions in a place she wasnt in 2019.michael barbaroAnd perhaps this is why shes ready for what ends up being this extraordinary moment that she encounters a couple of weeks ago.astead herndonYeah, and I think a lot of people were surprised at the speed at which the party unified around her. But it is explained a little more by the work shes done over the last couple of years. When she was going to events as VP, she was calling DNC members and creating those relationships. She was checking in with donors. She was growing a backroom reputation of someone who could lead the party, if necessary. And so when Biden drops and endorses her, she leaned on all of those things to really coalesce support very quickly. And I think there was a greater willingness to see her as someone who could step up to the top of the ticket, because of the advocacy she was doing on issues like abortion over the last couple of years. And so she laid the foundation to really seize that opportunity once it arrived.michael barbaroAnd yet, thats the story of party insiders rallying around her, perhaps a step because of what she did over the past two years as vice president. But it still feels true that the American public doesnt really know what she stands for and exactly who she is. And at this point, its unclear whether thats going to matter in a race where there was so much unhappiness about Biden and Trump. But thats an unusual thing, as we said at the beginning of this conversation.astead herndonYeah. I mean, a lot of the work we are talking about, to your point, is insider political stuff. For most people, I think she was running for president, she became vice president, kind of went away, and now shes the nominee. And so I think that is the reason why Republicans are trying to paint her as flimsy and nonsubstantive. And although at this moment, shes been able to step away from 2019 and say, that wasnt the real version of me, I do think it leads to the question, what is then? And I think over the next three months, the onus is on the campaign to tell that story. And I think that starts at the DNC.michael barbaroLets talk about that story for just a second, because there is a clear story to tell of a young girl who grows up in Black Oakland, child of activists, becomes a prosecutor in the name of bringing that identity and pride inside an institution that she thinks needs to change with her at the center of that change, and the application of that approach of hers to criminal justice, an approach that, like Harris herself, defies being easily put into boxes. Its the story of somebody who believes you can be multiple things at the same time. You can be an empathetic Progressive, but also believe in punishment and in accountability. But my question is, is that a story which we know she didnt want to tell in 2019-2020, that she wants to tell now? The story that you have been telling us here.astead herndonYes.michael barbaroIs that going to be at the center of her campaign?astead herndonYes. I think that the biggest change from 2019 to now is a comfort with that story and a political moment thats more ready to receive it. And so already she has said the words prosecutor maybe more than she said in four years ago. And with Donald Trump on the other side, a convicted felon with looming charges, accountability is on the comeback. And she was going to own that type of framing.michael barbaroA story very faithful to who Kamala Harris was that was hard to sell last time she ran and that she kind of ran away from, now feels like the story she should be embracing and that the country might very much embrace.astead herndonYeah. I think she will return to that articulation. And so the moment of unity were seeing now was always under the surface possible. And I think a lot of that is because she is a vessel that you can see what you want to see in. If you want to see a Progressive, theres enough there you probably can. If you want to see a moderate, you probably can see that too. And so what I think is one of the stories here is a ideological fluidity that was once seen as a problem is now being seen as a solution.michael barbaroAstead, were talking about Kamala Harris here as a candidate in a race thats going to be over in a few months. And youre suggesting that her ideological fluidity might benefit her in a race like this. If she wins, though, the question is going to become, what does that fluidity mean for her as actual president in the hot seat? And what kind of philosophy is this former prosecutor who, as youve laid it out, has always been most comfortable thinking still in the mind of a law and order person? Whats that going to look like when shes commander in chief and leader of the free world?astead herndonAbsolutely. We dont know. But come governing time, all of this fluidity will be put to the test. And we dont know what type of president she would be. I mean, we dont know what the agenda of a Kamala Harris Democratic Party would look like and how that would differ from the one that Biden has laid out. But frankly, if you ask any Democrat, they would say thats tomorrows problem. And as long as she wins the election and stops Donald Trump from winning another term, they dont care. They really dont care.[laughs]Theyll deal with that then.michael barbaroRight. Thats the thing about a tomorrow problem, you deal with it tomorrow.astead herndonYeah. Yeah. Who cares?michael barbaroAstead thank you very much. Really appreciate it.astead herndonThank you for having me. [UPBEAT MUSIC]michael barbaro",

            "text": "Alegras, which means \"joys\" in Spanish, are a delightful Mexican treat with a rich history rooted in Mesoamerica. These sweet, crunchy, no-bake snack bars get their name from the way amaranth seeds \"jump for joy\" as they pop in a hot pan, and also from the traditional harvesting method of jumping and dancing on plants to release seeds. Originating in the barrios of Xochimilco, a Mexico City borough famous for its ancient floating gardens, alegras showcase the versatility of amaranth, a drought-resistant plant cultivated for thousands of years. In this recipe, honey, dried cherries and cinnamon combine with anise seeds to give a distinctive licorice flavor that adds depth to the sweetness. Pop your own amaranth if you dont mind a few kernels jumping for joy out of your pan, or use store-bought puffed amaranth for a quick and easy lunchbox or deskside treat.",

One doughnut-shop secret to the perfect apple fritter: use a lot of cinnamon. It is going to seem like a mistake, but fried doughnuts (see Tip) require a lot more apple, cinnamon and salt for the flavor to punch through than if they were baked. The second trick, which achieves that crispy but melt in your mouth texture: chop the dough. It might seem a bit fussy but they dont have to be exact cuts, you just need -inch pieces.

Put 1 tablespoon of the pea mixture in the center and pull all the edges of the dough up and around it into a ball, being careful not to let the outermost edges get wet with filling. Twist and pull the edges together to close them, pinching off all the excess dough at the same time. (Try not to rip the dough, or oil will get inside the kachori when you fry it.

She spent a lot of time in pubs on early '90s London business trips, and the only vegetarian dish was very often a baked potato. This is where she discovered the ingenuity of filling a soft, steamy potato with all kinds of tasty toppings that absorb nicely into the starchy flesh. In this recipe, she subs out the big potato for smaller, thin-skinned ones (for a prettier presentation), and the bacon bits, chives and packaged cheese for spicier, brighter toppings: chiles, chaat masala, onions and ginger. This dish takes almost no time to put together once the potatoes are baked, but looks very impressive as an appetizer or a small side. Tip: Cut the ginger, onion and chiles while the potatoes bake, so everything is ready for assembly. Priya Krishna",

Replace the damp cloth over the remaining pastry sheets to keep them from drying out. Take the bottom-right corner of the rectangle and fold it over the top, with the short side extending 1 to 2 inches past the top. The overlapping pastry at the bottom right of the sheet will form an equilateral triangle with sides that are about 3 inches long. This triangle will be the final shape and size of the samosa. Fold the triangle so its right outer edge is aligned with the horizontal bottom edge of the sheet. There should now be a triangular pocket with two flaps sticking out to the left. Pick up the pocket so it is open and upright like a cone. Fill the cone with 2 teaspoons of the filling. Using the back of a small spoon, spread the flour paste in a thin layer over the remaining strip of pastry. Fold it over the stuffed triangle to seal the samosa. If the corners of the samosa have any gaps, fill them with the flour paste and pinch them to seal. Repeat with the remaining filling and rectangles (you may have leftover wrappers) and lay on the lined sheet pan, spacing apart. They can be fried or baked right away, or frozen on the pan until firm, then sealed in an airtight container or freezer bag. They can be frozen for up to 2 months before frying and go straight into the hot oil from the freezer.",

            "text": "This traditional Hungarian pepper stew recipe delivers a flavor-packed one-pot meal thats perfect for any busy weeknight. Every family has their own version, but at its root, lecs is a paprika-spiced stew with melting onions, peppers and tomatoes. The vegetables are simmered together until saucy, jammy and glossy; the sweetness of the onions and peppers is offset by tomatoes, making this an irresistibly balanced dish that is light but satisfying. Hungarian peppers would be ideal. Typically enjoyed at their yellow stage, they are sweet and savory with a mild heat level. Red bell peppers are more modest, with their predominantly sweet flavor, but make a delicious option for this recipe. The dish, adapted from Pass the Plate by Carolina Gelen (Clarkson Potter, 2024), is vegan as written, but you can use this foundational recipe to make it your own. Some people serve it with fried or scrambled eggs, some with sausage or other meats, some use animal fat to cook the vegetables. Each version will bring comfort and flavor to your table.",

            "text": "These pumpkin-orange rice balls, studded with crunchy peanuts, come from Simply West African (Clarkson Potter, 2023) by the chef Pierre Thiam and the writer Lisa Katayama. Canned pumpkin works just fine here, but theres nothing like the jack-o-lantern aroma of fresh steamed squash (see Tip). The action of mashing and stirring a fresh pot of rice until the loose grains hold one shape feels almost as if youre kneading bread, though, Mr. Thiam says, a more accurate parallel would be the act of making fufu, the pounded meal thats central to West African cuisine. Make the rice balls whatever size you like; they make excellent finger food, especially dipped in maaf, the velvety, rich Senegalese peanut stew (often called groundnut stew) that tastes like savoriness incarnate.

I used 2 cups of chicken broth for 1 cup of white basmati rice and cooked for about 28 minutes. It still had not absorbed 100% of the liquid, so I may try a tad below 2 cups next time.

Replace the damp cloth over the remaining pastry sheets to keep them from drying out. Take the bottom-right corner of the rectangle and fold it over the top, with the short side extending 1 to 2 inches past the top. The overlapping pastry at the bottom right of the sheet will form an equilateral triangle with sides that are about 3 inches long. This triangle will be the final shape and size of the samosa. Fold the triangle so its right outer edge is aligned with the horizontal bottom edge of the sheet. There should now be a triangular pocket with two flaps sticking out to the left. Pick up the pocket so it is open and upright like a cone. Fill the cone with 2 teaspoons of the filling. Using the back of a small spoon, spread the flour paste in a thin layer over the remaining strip of pastry. Fold it over the stuffed triangle to seal the samosa. If the corners of the samosa have any gaps, fill them with the flour paste and pinch them to seal. Repeat with the remaining filling and rectangles (you may have leftover wrappers) and lay on the lined sheet pan, spacing apart. They can be fried or baked right away, or frozen on the pan until firm, then sealed in an airtight container or freezer bag. They can be frozen for up to 2 months before frying and go straight into the hot oil from the freezer.",

Caramelizing onions takes a good half-hour, so save this recipe for when you have a little extra time and company (this recipe serves two). If time permits, you could even prep them ahead in a slow cooker. Rather than layer the grated Gruyre and the warm caramelized onions in the sandwich, you should stir them together before assembling, which guarantees that the cheese will melt evenly throughout and that each bite will contain the perfect ratio of fragrant cheese to jammy onions. A splash of sherry, red-wine or white-wine vinegar added to the onions balances out the buttery flavors, but a side salad dressed with a tangy mustard vinaigrette would do the trick, too.

Brush each donut one by one on all sides - top and bottom - in the melted butter, and then immediately after drop the donut into the cinnamon sugar bowl on both sides to coat the whole donut, gently tossing as needed. Do this one by one. This way the donuts wont absorb the butter and get soggy. And just dropping cinnamon sugar on top of them is really inefficient. 2) Agree with others that 6 TBSPs of melted butter for coating 12 donuts is way too much. You can easily halve it to 3 TBSPs. 3) Agree with others both to be careful about separating ingredients for batter vs coating and that the batter could have more spice! I accidentally put the full 2 TSPs cinnamon in the batter but the donuts smelled and tasted delicious so Id probably do it again on purpose.Is this helpful?",

These will have a foot similar to a macaron and will appear a deep golden color because of the extra egg yolk. I used a 1T measuring spoon to scoop the dough (2/cookie). This produces a relatively large cookie that is both chewy and cake-like on the inside and crispy outside. As others note, there is a fair amount of spread as they bake. I put 8 cookies each on parchment lined, full sized baking sheet and yielded 20 cookies. 1T/scoop would work well for bite-sized cookies. They are quite sweet. While Im not as in love with these as other commenters, I will absolutely keep them in my recipe box and make them again. Very easy to bring together the dough and about 12 min bake time.Is this helpful?",

Even when I added more broth and cream (probably doubling the original measurements) I splashed on some more broth before baking. Two tablespoons of flour would probably be sufficient. As for construction, I would hold out the chicken and sandwich it between layers of the other mixed ingredients. That would ensure even distribution of the protein. With all that said, my husband and I thought it was delicious. Very reminiscent of chicken Tetrazzini, another old-school casserole. (My favorite recipe has a sauce made with 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour, 2 cups chicken stock, 1 and a 1/4 cups milk, 1/4 cup dry sherry, and 1 cup heavy cream, salt, pepper, and a hint of nutmeg).

Before pressure cooking, I used the saut function and seared the pork on all sides and then I used the Jalepeo brine that this recipe calls for to deglaze the char in the instant pot, this worked as well as a chicken or beef stock.

Ground turkey or pork would be just as good, if you prefer. Russets can be substituted for Yukon golds, but their texture will be more grainy and less creamy. Mature spinach or frozen spinach works best here because of its mellow flavor, as opposed to baby spinach, which is more tannic.

            "text": "How Does a Pressure Cooker Work?Dating to the 17th century, the first pressurized cooking pot was developed by the French physicist Denis Papin. Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.A pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers  stovetop and electric  are quite safe. They dont explode as your grandmothers may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.For a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, theyre heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the pots temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isnt hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.With an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cooks having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And dont worry: It wont explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high.",

My one modificationI typically use just one cup of the packed brown sugar and find that reducing the sugar has brought out more complex flavors from the spices and salt that otherwise would be overpowered by the hefty amount of sugar called for in this recipe. And, they are still plenty sweet. Highly recommend!Is this helpful?",

Like the stir-fry, this tomato soup is on the sweet side, with sharpness from the untraditional addition of ketchup. There are several ways to drop an egg: Beating the eggs lightly will result in both white and yellow swirls, while running a chopstick or wooden spoon through the egg as it cooks will produce long, willowy strands. This recipe calls for dropping the egg into the hot soup and leaving it, which will give you chunks. A tip: If you have a liquid measuring cup with a spout, beat the egg in that, as it will give you more control when pouring the egg into the hot liquid. If you want the soup spicy, top with chile oil or chile crisp.",

As long as the habaneros are seeded and halved and only rest in the sauce and then removed after cooking, as opposed to chopped and otherwise left in, they contribute great flavor and a very manageable spice! I have one tip and one tip only for those who have issues with pork chops tasting bland brine BRINE BRIIIIIIIINE!!! Pork chops like all meat need salt, and its amazing what a simple brine will do for your pork and chicken. We make a simple brine of equal parts (about 1/4 cup) kosher salt and brown sugar and add a few garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and peppercorns. You can play around with any herbs and flavors you want in your brine. Dissolve the salt and sugar, cool it down (for food safety purposes) and stick the chops in to refrigerate for anywhere from 4-12 hours. You could literally just cook them as is at this point, but a brine elevates a recipe like this as well to be amazing and flavorful. Dont skip brining your chops!!!Is this helpful? 1",

One suggestion- the recipe calls for slicing 1/4 inch off of the TOP of the garlic. Ive always roasted garlic by cutting the BOTTOM of the garlic bulb, but did as instructed this time. Immediately, I realized that this was a mistake, as all of the cloves were no longer attached to each other. I tried to hold it all together while getting the little nuggets into the foil, but it was difficult. When I had to squeeze the garlic out, I had to handle each clove individually. Not ideal. Cut the bottom off the cloves will stay connected, and youll just squeeze the whole bulb into the soup. This was delicious, and Ill be making it again later this week for friends.

Let the mixture come to a boil and use the wet pastry brush to brush down the sides of the saucepan to dissolve any stuck-on sugar crystals. (Dont forget to check the egg white mixture and turn off the mixer whenever necessary.) Clip the candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan (its OK if its coated in honey), reduce the heat to medium and boil the mixture without stirring, occasionally swirling the saucepan, until it registers 310 degrees, then remove from the heat immediately. With the mixer running on medium-high speed, stream the sugar mixture into the bowl just as you did the honey. Once youve added all of the sugar mixture, increase the speed to high and continue to beat until the sides of the bowl are warm but not hot and the mixture is very thick, dense and voluminous, about 4 minutes (the mixer might strain against the mixture).",

It's almost as good as fresh and certainly better than dried.Is this helpful? 1149",

This recipe is so persnickety with the method of cooking this, but not the amount of garlic. It would be more helpful if, instead of 20 garlic cloves, which is an open ended amount, it was measured by cups or grams or ounces. Also, boiling the pasta in a shallow pan does make it overcooked and creamy, but its also quite dangerous. When youre swirling it around so that it doesnt clump together, some of the water does come out of the pan and burn your foot, which is what happened to me, so I wish that issue was addressed. I enjoyed the results of this recipe, but it is flawed.Is this helpful?",

If re-elected, he has vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Mr. Biden and his family.Mr. Trump has declared that he would use the powers of the presidency to seek vengeance on his perceived foes. His allies have developed a legal rationale to erase the Justice Departments independence from the president.

Asked about her former advocacy for giving drivers licenses, college tuition and free health care to undocumented immigrants, she replied, Listen, that was five years ago. Those words hold a valuable lesson for a progressive movement more often heard quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s famous and rather different declaration that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.Dr. Kings line, originally from a 19th-century abolitionist and preacher named Theodore Parker, has become so embedded in modern American progressivism that President Barack Obama had it woven into an Oval Office rug. Justice, in this thinking, is not some ideologically neutral improvement of the human condition but rather a progressive notion of social justice, greater rights and autonomy and triumph over systemic forces of oppression. History has a right side, and it is the left side.Sure enough, the United States has steadily expanded rights and lifted marginalized groups  making good on what Dr. King called the promissory note of the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. American culture has steadily liberalized  tolerating, then accepting, then welcoming a broadening range of beliefs and identities. Thus the boundless confidence of young activists that whatever radical idea they pursue next will someday become conventional wisdom. Thus, too, the nervous and awkward following along by older progressives, who dare not risk a position that might seem reactionary.But what the moral universes long arc really has is survivorship bias. Progressive causes that achieved success and bettered the nation, like the New Deals worker protections and the civil rights movement of the 1960s, are highly visible today and taught in history books as important inflection points. But for every success, there are also many failures  bold ideas that proved not ahead of their time but simply foolish. Having flickered only briefly in the national consciousness, they are easily forgotten.",

When Betts snagged the ball with his glove above the padded wall, Capobianco gripped Betts glove with both hands, opened it, reached inside with his right hand and knocked the ball back onto the field. The umpires ruled the play fan interference and Torres was out.Capobiancos brother, Darren, 29, said he saw Betts glove go over the concrete wall as he tried to make a catch on Torres hit.I just see the ball kind of  I dont want to say (go) up for grabs, if that makes sense, Darren Capobianco said. And then Mookie was swearing at us. Not good.After the game, Betts said that his wrist felt perfectly fine, and he brushed off questions about the incident, which he called irrelevant because the Dodgers lost.It doesnt matter, Betts said, when asked if hed ever seen fans act so aggressively. We lost, its irrelevant, Im fine, hes fine, everythings cool. We lost the game, thats what Im kind of focused on, turn the page. Everythings fine.Austin Capobianco is a Yankee Stadium season-ticket holder, his brother said.Immediately, security guards walked over to Austin Capobianco, who tried to argue with them that Betts glove had reached into foul territory, according to a video obtained by The Athletic. Ana Flamengo, a Yankees fan from Connecticut, said she was standing on the concourse when stadium security escorted Austin Capobianco from the stands.AdvertisementI saw him being walked out, Flamengo said. I told him he was my hero for trying to save the Yankees. Its the championship game.A league spokesperson confirmed that two fans were ejected.That was one of the most aggressive fan ripping the ball out of his glove (incidents) that Ive ever seen, longtime former MLB umpire Dale Scott said.Dodgers pitcher Ben Casparius, who was on the mound at the time, was simply glad that umps called the batter out. Never seen anything like that, he said. It was interesting, especially I think it being the second or third pitch of the game, an interesting start to the game for sure.The Dodgers Tommy Edman didnt care for how the interaction played out.That looked ridiculous from my perspective, Edman said.The guy was trying to yank (Betts) glove off, pulling at his wrist, looked like he got ejected, and Im glad he did. Ive never seen anything like that. That was unacceptable.The Athletics Evan Drellich, Rustin Dodd and Sam Blum contributed to this story.Required reading(Photo: Robert Deutsch / Imagn Images)",

            "text": "As the contest for the White House draws to a close, I asked a wide range of scholars and political strategists where they think the blame will go, whether it is Kamala Harris or Donald Trump who wins.Their answers varied widely.William Galston is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Harris, he wrote in an email,has run a surprisingly centrist presidential campaign while the partys progressive wing has bitten its tongue. If she wins, the gloves will come off, and progressives will probably repeat what they did during the first two years of the Biden administration  pressure the new president to support their agenda.But, Galston noted, even if Harris wins,Republicans are likely to take control of the Senate. If so, Harris would be forced to negotiate with a Senate Republican leadership to get anything done, reducing the influence of the left on her administration, and House Democrats would face a choice between gridlock and accepting whatever the administration could get from a Republican-led Senate.How would Harris exercise presidential executive authority?Galston:The answer to this question depends on who she really is  a former progressive mugged by reality and transformed into a Biden Democrat, or an actual progressive who is trimming her sails to close the deal with moderate voters. If its the latter, expect the rule-making process to tilt left, especially on cultural issues. If its the former, the Harris administration will disappoint the left on immigration, crime and education, among other issues.Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, also replied to my queries by email:If Harris wins it will be because she successfully jettisoned the progressive dogma that doomed Democratic primary candidates in the 2020 cycle and made a convincing case to mainstream voters that she is a Democratic centrist. Her decisive move to the center began on the day Joe Biden stepped back from the race and culminated in her convention speech, which was the most centrist of any Democratic nominee in memory, including Bill Clinton in 1992.Harriss embrace, Kessler continued, ofopportunity economics and capitalism helped her close the economy gap with Donald Trump. Her tough on the border policies have closed some of the border gap with Trump. Her accountability and prevention framing and touting her personal gun ownership has helped her on crime. All of these are tier one issues for voters and issues in which Democrats suffered huge deficits.What if Trump wins?Kessler:If Harris loses, progressives will argue publicly that her moving to the center was the cause. Frankly, I dont think even they will believe it. If you watch the swing state ads against Harris or congressional Democrats like Sherrod Brown, they are devastating frontal assaults on progressive liturgy. Every ad is about chaos at the border, out-of-control city streets, runaway inflation and mischaracterizations on transgender issues.How will Republicans react to a Trump defeat?Lets be realistic, Kessler wrote:There are only two outcomes in the minds of the Trump people  he wins or it was stolen from him. What happens to Republicans after a Trump loss will depend on whether enough Republicans tell Trump that they have lost patience with his stolen election charade. If youre counting on courage from congressional Republicans, dont bet the house on it.Ruy Teixeira, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a co-author of The Emerging Democratic Majority, contended that even before the votes have been counted, the progressive movement in the Democratic Party is dead in its tracks. His views of the cultural left are unrelentingly hostile.",

Ask her a question to which she doesnt have a canned answer and she struggles for a coherent response. The most notable difference between her current presidential bid and her previous one in 2019 is that she has repudiated many of her past views. Is it because shes hiding her real convictions  or because she has few real convictions at all?Yet Im going to vote for her. Other conservatives should, too.Why? Because Donald Trump is worse. He isnt worse because hes a fascist: If he were, his outspoken opponents would have wound up in prison, not on MSNBC. He isnt worse because his presidency was an unremitting failure: The (prepandemic) economy thrived, Operation Warp Speed was a triumph, the world was more at peace than it is today and there were important diplomatic achievements such as the Abraham Accords. Nor is he the only one who can disrespect political norms: Its Harris, not Trump, who is campaigning on ending the Senate filibuster and perhaps packing the Supreme Court.But Trump is worse in ways that matter profoundly to the rule of law, the health of capitalism and the future of freedom at home and abroad. Conservatives who claim to care about these things should also care about what Trump may do to each of them  and, crucially, do so in the name of conservatism. Consider:Law. Conservatives are indignant about the flimsy civil and criminal cases progressive prosecutors have brought against Trump  cases they almost certainly wouldnt have brought against anyone else.But politicizing justice is exactly what Trump sought to do during his presidency. He tried to strong-arm Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, into participating in a dirt-digging expedition against Joe and Hunter Biden. His Justice Department tried to block a merger between AT&T and Time Warner in 2017, almost certainly out of presidential spite against CNN. He appointed a hack as an acting attorney general and took legal advice from conspiracy theorists, including Sidney Powell.",

            "text": "NEW YORK  Anthony Volpes jersey was caked in dirt as he fielded grounders at shortstop before the ninth inning of Game 4 of the World Series. The New York Yankees were on the brink of a victory that would keep their season alive.Then, the most exhilarating moment of Volpes life unfolded.Like many kids who grew up playing baseball in the New York area, Volpe dreamed of becoming the Yankees shortstop and a franchise icon like his hero, Derek Jeter. While the odds of such a dream coming true are nearly impossible, Volpe now lives it every day.AdvertisementHis deep-rooted Yankees fandom spans generations. His great-grandfather immigrated from Italy and made a living selling fruit from a pushcart in downtown Manhattan. He later fought in World War II and returned home with shrapnel wounds. Volpes grandfather was just 4 years old when his father went to war, and upon his return, they bonded over Yankees games on the radio. Every night, trying to make up for lost time, the two would share stories of life and baseball.Growing up, Volpe wore No. 7 in honor of his grandfathers idol, Mickey Mantle. So Tuesday night embodied a dream fulfilled for Volpe and his ancestors. He launched a go-ahead grand slam in the third inning, giving the Yankees a 5-2 lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also stole two bases, becoming the first Yankee to hit a grand slam and steal multiple bases in a game  regular season or postseason  since none other than Mantle.But the moment that stood out the most came with the Yankees leading 11-4 in the ninth inning. Nearly 50,000 fans at Yankee Stadium erupted and began chanting Vol-pe! Vol-pe! Vol-pe! He turned toward the Bleacher Creatures and saluted them, striving to maintain his composure. Deep down, the 23-year-old was experiencing the pinnacle of his lifes journey.Number one, Volpe exclaimed with pure joy. Definitely number one.Yankee Stadium hadnt erupted like it did Tuesday in 15 years, not since Game 6 of the 2009 World Series. Shortly after that victory, an 8-year-old Volpe watched the championship parade with his family, dreaming of one day parading down the Canyon of Heroes as fans chanted his name the same way he did for Jeter.Fifteen years later, on the set of Foxs postgame show, Jeter playfully ribbed Volpe, suggesting he should have been in school instead of at the parade.AdvertisementBut with the Yankees down 3-1 in the World Series and history against them, Volpe admitted he hadnt fully grasped the significance of Tuesday night.Hopefully, when we win the World Series and Im with my family, we can reflect on everything, Volpe said. It was just a big game. We wanted to go 1-0 today and see where it takes us.Volpe envisioned nights like Tuesday probably every night as a child. He doesnt take for granted that this dream was shared by his friends, his cousins, and his sister, Olivia. But winning the World Series always loomed as his top aspiration.Anthony Volpe could only dream of nights like Tuesday, only this time, he made it a reality. (Sarah Stier / Getty Images)Nothing else compares, Volpe said. So theres still a lot of work to do.Austin Wells, Volpes best friend on the team, felt the ground shake when Volpe hit his grand slam. The two had often discussed what this moment would feel like if they reached this stage together.Wells spent countless nights at Volpes childhood home, poring over old Yankees footage and imagining the electric atmosphere of an October crowd at Yankee Stadium. On Tuesday, he experienced it, hitting a solo home run into the second deck to extend the Yankees lead to 6-4. Earlier, he smacked a double with Volpe on second base; although Volpes base-running blunder may have cost the Yankees an additional run, it ultimately didnt matter as the offense finally broke through against the Dodgers bullpen.Los Angeles opted not to use its high-leverage relievers, believing it will certainly win one of the next three games, rendering a Game 4 loss moot. However, the Yankees faced a must-win scenario. If the Yankees mount a comeback, it will surely deserve its own Netflix documentary, like the Red Sox one on the streaming platform now, and the offensive explosion led by Volpes grand slam in Game 4 should be its starting point.We were down 2-0, but we still said, Hey, this aint gonna be easy, but this is what were made for,' Jazz Chisholm Jr. said. Who doesnt want to make history? I love making history. I love writing my name in the history books.After Game 4, Volpe spent a few moments with the Fox postgame crew, where David Ortiz, well-acquainted with comebacks from 3-0 deficits, gifted Volpe a shirt featuring Big Papi in a Red Sox jersey with the caption, My Dawg! Volpe chuckled, insisting he wouldnt ever wear it, knowing it would be sacrilegious to don Boston gear.AdvertisementYet, even more meaningful than the shirt were Jeters words on set. In the same way he idolized Jeter, countless New York kids now aspire to be like Volpe, dreaming of one day hitting a grand slam in the World Series at Yankee Stadium as the franchises shortstop.And perhaps, if theyre lucky, theyll one day recount how that grand slam led to baseball immortality.(Top photo: Sarah Stier / Getty Images)",

It was also one of only a handful of attacks by a foreign air force in Iran since its war with Iraq in the 1980s.Although it was a significant moment, Iran did not immediately set a time frame for a retaliation. The Iranian foreign ministry said that while Iran was obliged to defend itself, it was aware of its responsibilities for regional peace and security, avoiding the kind of bombastic language that characterized Irans initial responses to previous Israeli attacks.That eased fears that an uncontrollable conflict was about to break out, even if the prospect of such a clash has edged ever closer.",

He repeatedly raised the idea of using troops to secure border states, and even proposed shooting both violent protesters and undocumented migrants in the legs, former aides have said.In his first term in office, Mr. Trump never realized his expansive vision of using troops to enforce the law on U.S. soil. But as he has sought a return to power, he has made clear that he intends to use the military for a range of domestic law enforcement purposes, including patrolling the border, suppressing protests that he deems to have turned into riots and even fighting crime in big cities run by Democrats.In places where there is a true breakdown of the rule of law, such as the most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago, the next president should use every power at his disposal to restore order  and, if necessary, that includes sending in the National Guard or the troops, Mr. Trump said at a conservative conference in Dallas in August 2022, shortly before announcing that he was running to be that next president.",

The message pushed by Civic Truth Action  purportedly to help Mr. Terry but aimed at siphoning votes from former President Donald J. Trump  may be among the most cynical. But it is far from unique.

            "text": "NEW YORK  One more day of summer. For every team faced with an early demise in the World Series, thats the vision: one more day of summer to play with your friends. Youll have to face the winter soon enough.So on Tuesday afternoon, under steel-gray skies in the steel-gray fortress of Yankee Stadium, Anthony Rizzo gave voice to what all of his teammates were thinking.AdvertisementToday could be our last drive to the ballpark, said Rizzo, the veteran first baseman. Today could be the last time this teams ever together.The everyday rhythms are part of baseballs charm, the routine a source of comfort in a game so capricious. The New York Yankees did not think they had played very badly in this World Series, yet theyd lost the first three games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. No team in the last half-century had faced that deficit and won another game.We were down 2-0 and we said, Hey, this ss not gonna be easy, but this is what were made for, third baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. said. We lost Game 3 and we said, Hey, who doesnt want to make history? I know I love making history. I love writing my name in the history books and being a part of it. So lets do it.After thumping the Dodgers, 11-4, these Yankees have lots of chiseling to do before carving their place in history as the only team to win the World Series after losing the first three games.But what you heard in their clubhouse after Game 4 was the sound of hope, of a plausible scenario for a singular achievement. On Wednesday, Rizzo noted, the Yankees will face Jack Flaherty and the Dodgers cast of high-leverage relievers. Theyve seen them all before, and theyll be ready.The flight to L.A. will be really special if we make that happen, Rizzo said.Eight years ago with the Chicago Cubs, Rizzo played another Game 5 on Halloween eve, needing a win to extend the World Series. The Cubs trusted an ace starter, Jon Lester, and a well-rested closer, Aroldis Chapman, for a win that clinched a final road trip for a tight group. The Cubs would return from Cleveland as champions.Now the Yankees can use their top starter, Gerrit Cole, to start Game 5, with relief ace Luke Weaver relatively fresh after throwing only 21 pitches Tuesday. The Yankees five-run rally in the eighth padded their lead and saved Weaver from working another inning.Gleyber Torres three-run homer was the big blow then, but the preceding at-bat had the Yankees buzzing. With one out and runners at second and third, Alex Verdugo wore down Brent Honeywell Jr. for 11 pitches. His bouncer to second scored Anthony Volpe and set up the blast that followed.I know he probably didnt put up the numbers in the regular season that he wanted to, Aaron Judge, who was 1 for 3, said of Verdugo. But all year long he just said: Get me to the postseason and Ill do something special. And thats what weve seen so far this whole postseason.Verdugo hasnt actually been Reggie Jackson; hes hitting .200/.280/.311 in October, even worse than his regular season numbers (.233/.291/.356). But his one home run this month came with two on and two outs in the ninth inning of Game 3  a jolt of confidence for a slumbering offense.AdvertisementThe Dodgers started Game 4 just as they had the night before, with a two-run homer by Freddie Freeman in the top of the first. But while it was the same kind of hit, this one packed less punch. The Yankees were too awestruck to be discouraged.My first thought is: this guy is superhuman, Weaver said. Youre sitting there kind of marveling at what hes doing. So youve got to give him all the respect and appreciation for what hes doing on the biggest stage. But, I mean, youre looking at it and its early, right? Youre not like, Oh, its a repeat.It was an all-new episode with a mostly fresh cast of Dodgers pitchers. Three of them were new to this World Series and covered seven innings. The pitcher the Yankees had seen already, Daniel Hudson, allowed Volpes go-ahead grand slam in the third.It really just takes one big swing, and I feel like that was Volpes big swing there, said catcher Austin Wells, who doubled and homered like Volpe. It allowed everyone to just take a deep breath and have fun. I think also the situation we were in, we just kind of needed to say screw it and go after it and have fun because some guys may never come back to the World Series again.Volpe sure had fun; by the end, his muddy uniform was so brown that youd think he played for the San Diego Padres. He lived the fantasy of every New York-born kid of his generation: a shortstop in pinstripes, starring in the World Series. He could get used to this extra month of work.Its my first playoffs, but these have been probably the craziest things Ive ever been a part of, Volpe said. So its just foot on the gas, always.The Yankees stalled for three games. Now the engine is purring. Theyre still tracing a narrow path on the edge of a cliff, trying to do what no team has ever done: not just winning the World Series after losing the first three games, but simply forcing a Game 6.AdvertisementMaybe theyll make history. Maybe  probably  they wont. But theyre still playing, and thats the best they can do for now.I feel like today is a reminder to show you why were in the World Series, why we got this far, Chisholm said, and why we dont expect to be done.(Top photo of the Yankees bench celebrating Gleyber Torres home run in Game 4: Elsa / Getty Images)",

            "text": "The false claimInfluencers and social media users have falsely claimed that voter fraud is the reason it took days to count all votes and decide the winner in the 2020 election, and that it could again in 2024.Why it is falseIts true that most elections in modern U.S. history have been called on election night or the next day, with some exceptions. In 2000, it took more than a month to determine a winner because of a closely fought race that came down to a recount in Florida, which also involved disputed ballots. In 2020, it took four days to determine that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had defeated the incumbent, President Donald J. Trump. A surge in mail-in voting and closely fought races in several swing states has meant that more votes must be counted before experts can call the race.This election may play out similarly to 2020 because:There is more mail voting and early voting compared with elections before 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic in the 2020 election upended voting patterns for many Americans. So far this year, there are signs that those changes have persisted, with more people voting early and by mail than in previous elections.Most state legislatures prevent counting ballots before Election Day  or even preparing to count them. In Pennsylvania, many voters submit their ballots by mail, but state law prevents election officials from taking steps like verifying signatures and opening envelopes before Election Day. In 2020, it took Pennsylvania four days to determine that Mr. Biden had won the state.Polling also indicates this could be one of the closest elections in history, with the candidates effectively tied across the key battlegrounds. The final result could come down to a few thousand votes in a few swing states, meaning it could be difficult to call the winner in some states before nearly all votes are counted.There are other quirks too. For example, the ballots in Maricopa County, Arizonas most populous region, are spread across two pages this year, requiring election officials to process roughly twice as many pieces of paper compared with 2020. Election officials there said it could take 10 to 13 days to count all the ballots.",

            "text": "NEW YORK  The hometown kid came to the rescue on Tuesday, saving the New York Yankees from elimination in the World Series.Anthony Volpe, the New York-born shortstop who attended the Yankees last championship parade in 2009 as an 8-year-old, belted a go-ahead grand slam in the third inning of Game 4, powering the Yankees to a 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Bronx.AdvertisementThe Yankees  who got four critical outs from Luke Weaver  became the first team since 1970 to force a Game 5 after losing the first three games of the World Series. The last nine teams facing that deficit had been eliminated in Game 4.Freddie Freeman set a record in defeat, becoming the first player to hit homers in six consecutive World Series games, a streak that began with Atlanta in 2021. Freeman lined a two-run bullet to right in the first inning for the second game in a row, but the Dodgers failed in their effort to clinch the title with a bullpen game.Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers never got much going and the Yankees pulled away with a late offensive explosion. (Elsa / Getty Images)Analyzing the bullpen decisionsHeres the thing with how the Dodgers approached their bullpen game, particularly the third inning: Its largely in line with what worked for them in the National League Championship Series against the Mets when they ran this same playbook twice. The Dodgers got about what they expected out of Ben Casparius. They knew they would need multiple innings out of Landon Knack. Even though everyone was available for the Dodgers, using some of their top arms would have changed the calculus of how they approached a potential Game 5.Having Daniel Hudson take on the heart of the Yankees order brought understandable risk. His production faded over the season, largely because of his propensity for allowing the long ball. It was Volpe  not Juan Soto, Aaron Judge nor even Giancarlo Stanton  who took him out of the ballpark, but there were going be stretches in Game 4 when the Dodgers had to grit their teeth. Hudson clearly didnt have his command despite striking out the scariest matchup in Soto.Knack, warming up as the inning built, was a long-term play. Using another righty for Volpe with the bases loaded wouldve burned another arm for a pocket of left-handed hitters, and using one of their two lefties would have set up a less-than-ideal platoon spot. Using a leverage arm would have ramifications for a potential Game 5 and beyond.AdvertisementSo Hudson faced Volpe. He hung a slider. Volpe had struggled this postseason but did not miss his chance.Yankees provide a formula for a historic comebackThe Yankees had not gotten much production from the bottom of the order in the first three games of the World Series. Entering Game 4, the Yankees 7-8-9 batters had a combined four hits. On Tuesday, they combined for four hits through the first six innings.Volpe delivered that critical grand slam in the third inning, giving the Yankees a 5-2 lead. It was Volpes first home run since Sept. 21 and a reminder that he has power when he connects on a pitch. Volpe abandoned the power approach he showcased in his rookie season so he could increase his contact in Year 2. That decision backfired as he was a worse overall hitter. But for one night, Volpe turned back the clock and became the power-hitting shortstop the Yankees thought he would become.Austin Wells, who has struggled mightily over the past two months, smoked two batted balls. In the second inning, he hit a 406-foot double to center field that would have been gone in 17 ballparks. Wells then hit the ball over the fence in the sixth inning to give the Yankees a 6-4 lead.If the Yankees were to mount a historic comeback in this series, part of the formula is getting production up and down their lineup like they did in Game 4.Dodgers havent maximized their extra looks at the Yankees bullpenFor as much as the Dodgers have seen the Yankees bullpen, they have yet to accomplish what they usually do: take advantage of multiple looks, adjust and find the soft spots to break through. The Dodgers again chased a Yankee starter before he could complete the fifth inning, as Aaron Boone removed Luis Gil before the pitcher faced Shohei Ohtani a third time through the order. Ohtani immediately laced a single off Tim Hill and the Dodgers got two runs in the inning, but New Yorks bullpen wound up going the final five innings allowing zero runs.AdvertisementThrough four games this series, the Dodgers have managed 12 runs off Yankees starters in 16 innings. In 19 2/3 innings against the Yankees bullpen, theyve scored six  and just one since their furious comeback in Game 1. The prevailing theory is that seeing more out of a bunch of relievers should favor the hitters, particularly with fatigue setting in within a series. Its gone the wrong direction on the Dodgers hitters, which kept Games 2 and 3 from being bigger routs and impeded the Dodgers ability to come back in Game 4.Bullpen, Luke Weaver save the dayCloser Luke Weaver pulled off an incredible feat, tearing through the heart of the Dodgers order for four outs, and the rest of the relievers picked up starting pitcher Gil, who lasted just four innings.Weaver entered with two outs and a runner on second base in the seventh with the Yankees ahead 6-4. He immediately struck out Mookie Betts with a runner on second base. In the eighth inning, Weaver continued to dominate, retiring the side by getting Freeman to pop out and striking out Teoscar Hernndez and Max Muncy.Hill (2/3 innings), Clay Holmes (1 1/3 innings) and Mark Leiter Jr. (2/3 innings) combined to be the bridge to Weaver.In the ninth  with a seven-run lead thanks to a five-run eighth-inning rally  Tim Mayza finished things off with a 1-2-3 ninth.The Yankees will undoubtedly go into Wednesday with a tired bullpen. But facing elimination, all bets are off regarding whether Boone will rest anyone. If the Yankees can prevail, they will have Thursdays off day to recover before Game 6 on Friday in Los Angeles. Fortunately for them, they will start ace Gerrit Cole, who has been a workhorse throughout his career but hasnt topped 89 pitches in any of his four starts this postseason.(Top photo of Anthony Volpe: Elsa / Getty Images)",

Despite untold sums spent on advertising, a cavalcade of wild events  from felony convictions to assassination attempts to the incumbent president withdrawing from the race  here we sit, right on a razors edge.Over the past few days, other national news outlets have released polls telling the same story. CNN (where I am an on-air contributor) also had the race tied at 47 to 47 among likely voters. CBS News polling shows the contest effectively even, favoring Ms. Harris 50 to 49 among likely voters. (An exception to the pattern, polling by ABC News was a bit more bullish on Ms. Harris, at 51 to 47 among likely voters.)And yet these polls actually dont tell the same story. Though several of them show a dead heat, beneath the surface, they diverge in how they arrive at that result.Lets take two possible theories for how this election might unfold. The first theory, which Ill call the realignment, is that political divides like race and economic class are being replaced by divides like gender and education level. As the Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria writes: We are seeing a realignment in which the old categories of economic status and race are giving way to new categories such as social status and cultural divides around gender. We are likely at the beginning of this transformation of the political landscape.",

These include reversing federal guidance that says even states with bans must allow doctors to provide abortion in cases of medical emergency; using administrative agencies to ban abortion pills; and using his executive powers to achieve the anti-abortion movements ultimate goal: recognizing fetal personhood in the Constitution.",

Trump won over many working class voters in 2016 with his vows to impose tariffs and rework disastrous trade deals, Democrats have been scrambling to win back supporters by taking a more protectionist trade approach.Over the last four years, the Biden administration spent more time emphasizing the harm trade policy has caused to American communities than the benefits. It hit the brakes on negotiating trade deals with other countries and chose to maintain and even increase Mr. Trumps tariffs on Chinese products. And it pumped billions of dollars into new American factories to make semiconductors and solar panels.Its a significant shift from the decades that both mainstream Democrats and Republicans spent working to promote trade and lower international barriers.For Vice President Kamala Harris, next weeks election will be a moment of truth for whether the strategy worked.",

The gap by education is 29 points, with Mr. Trump ahead 10 points among people without a college degree and Ms. Harris ahead 19 points among those with one. But broken up by gender and education, we see that the gaps are driven particularly by men without a college degree and women with a college degree, with an overall difference of 43 points. Source: Pew Research, survey of U.S. adults conducted from Sept. 30 to Oct. 6, 2024.We are truly looking at two different Americas when we dig into the views of men without college degrees and women with college degrees. They are at opposite ends of the spectrum politically and experience essentially separate economies, and therefore give priority to distinct sets of character traits and issues.Lets take a closer look. Women with college degrees, who are generally more financially secure than other women, name abortion as one of the key issues deciding their vote, while both women and men without degrees tend to focus more on issues affecting their day-to-day finances or safety. While inflation affects everyone, it hits non-college-educated voters who feel they are falling behind hardest, especially now that the unemployment rate has been rising among those with less than a high school diploma.Our research indicates that economic issues matter deeply to many men without a college degree, who respond strongly to populist messages aimed at acknowledging their anxiety, sense of loss and resentment.These two groups also consume media in entirely different ways, which affects what they see and hear. Men  including those without college degrees  often spend time on X and Reddit, and many listen to podcasts and YouTube personalities concentrating on gaming, sports and politics. Women are more likely to frequent TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. Many seem more focused on content about personal growth, true crime and style.With the contrasts in priorities and worldview between these two groups, it makes sense that they would have different voting patterns, and the presence of a woman on the Democratic ticket has only accentuated that. Recent polling by the Pew Research Center shows non-college-educated men choosing Mr. Trump at a rate of 55 percent to 39 percent; college-educated women are nearly the inverse, favoring Ms. Harris by 61 percent to 34 percent. The gap may be even bigger by Election Day; it could be the largest in history.The large split between non-college-educated men and college-educated women began in 2016 +20 R (poll) Non-college men +10 R 0 43 pt. gap +10 D 39 pt. gap 41 pt. gap +20 D College women +30 D KerrY Bush Obama McCain Obama Romney Clinton Trump Biden Trump Harris Trump +40 D 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 +20 Rep.

KerrY Bush Obama McCain Obama Romney Clinton Trump Biden Trump Harris Trump +40 Dem. 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 Sources: American National Election Studies, Pew ResearchThis isnt a new trend. College-educated women have consistently voted for Democrats at high levels for years. But the divergence between non-college-educated men and college-educated women this year seems likely to surpass even its 2016 level.Mr. Trumps appeal to non-college-educated men is part of whats driving this shift. Before 2016, the gap between college-educated women and non-college-educated men was not as broad. But while Joe Biden made inroads among non-college-educated men in 2020, gaining 5 percent more of their vote compared to Hillary Clintons share in 2016, current support for Ms. Harris among men without college degrees has dropped back down almost to Mrs. Clintons 2016 levels. This could certainly in part be due to gender biases; non-college-educated men tend to be less receptive to the idea of women in executive positions. A study found that men without college degrees are least confident that a woman has what it takes to run a major American company (78 percent are confident compared to 91 percent of college-educated women). Our research suggests that they worry whether women are strong enough, can be respected by foreign leaders and are able to boost manufacturing.This campaign in particular shows that both parties have problems with key demographics. Years ago, Democrats could count on support from male union workers, but Mr. Trump is increasingly winning over those voters  not only because of his direct, emotional appeals to their anxiety and values, but also because Democrats have struggled to establish a compelling enough populist economic message or break into the media ecosystem that non-college-educated men consume.Mr. Trumps running mate, JD Vance, seems to have an especially potent attraction for some of these working-class voters. Increasingly, Republicans are the party of working- and middle-class people, said Mr. Vance, whose familys working-class background could be a powerful tool to bring in these non-college-educated men who turned to Mr. Biden in 2020, particularly white ones.As for Ms. Harris, she is particularly appealing to educated women. Republicans used to be stronger than Democrats with college-educated women, but that started to change in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan. Contemporaneous research indicated that educated women were more secular and more progressive on social issues than other voters at the time. They also supported government programs to provide a safety net and opportunity for all (sound familiar?). They opposed the Reagan tax cuts and deregulation and feared war. But many stuck with the Republican Party through the 2000s as part of the security mom coalition. We saw echoes of this in 2022 when Republican candidates in New York and elsewhere were able to leverage safety concerns to win over enough of these women to prevail on Election Day.Donald Trump on Joe Rogans podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, via YoutubeKamala Harris on Bren Browns podcast Bren Brown, via FacebookMs. Harris has been able to use abortion rights to bring back some women with college degrees who might otherwise have stayed with the Republicans. She already had a record of defending reproductive rights, and this year, she visited swing states to speak about abortion. Even in the early days of her campaign, she focused on abortion rights, vowing to restore the rights that had been enshrined in Roe v. Wade and organizing events in battleground states devoted to the issue. Women with college degrees were already a core base for Ms. Harris and the Democratic Party, but these moves helped increase her support among women of all ages. She and her campaign know that she needs to register and turn out voters who favor abortion rights to offset the non-college-educated men Mr. Trump is poised to win.While it might seem impossible for a candidate to appeal to both non-college-educated men and college-educated women, there are areas where policies and messaging could bridge the gap.A populist message, for example, could win more men without college degrees without alienating college-educated women, as anti-corporate sentiment is common among voters across the political spectrum and can play into concerns about both economic issues and freedom from control. Either party could leverage this sentiment.Both groups seem to want investments in public education and job skills training. Many in both groups are worried the next generation will not be as well off as the one before. Many want clean air and water and worry about pollution. Non-college-educated men tend to want to preserve natural areas for recreation like hunting, our data indicates, while college-educated women are particularly concerned about climate change. Both groups seek more respect and power, our research shows, and both see politics as a zero-sum game. The divide between these two groups seems unlikely to change before Election Day, but for either party to bridge the gap in the long term, it will need to work to appeal to both groups.The story of this election could well be the gender gap between those Americans who went to college and those who didnt. As the candidates consolidate support among their base, the divide between college-educated women and non-college-educated men seems almost impossible for Ms. Harris or Mr. Trump to overcome. The big question for America going forward is, can these two groups be brought together after a campaign that has only driven them further apart?Celinda Lake, president of Lake Research Partners, was one of two lead pollsters for Joe Bidens 2020 presidential campaign.

            "text": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Virginia to purge about 1,600 people from its voter rolls, handing a temporary victory to Republican officials in the state who said the move was necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting.The decision was provisional as the case moves forward, though it will apply to the election next week. The order, which did not include a vote count, gave no reasoning and was unsigned, as is typical in cases decided on the emergency docket. But it noted that Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the states request to continue the voter purge.The case is among a handful of election-related disputes to reach the Supreme Court in the final days before the election. On Tuesday, the justices batted away a bid by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped his independent campaign for the White House in August, to remove his name from the ballots in two crucial battleground states, Michigan and Wisconsin.The voter dispute in Virginia arose in the months before the election, when Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, signed an executive order to hasten the removal of suspected noncitizens from the states voter rolls. In fact, studies show that noncitizens voting is extremely rare, though Republicans, including former President Donald J. Trump and his allies, have continued to deploy the claim.",

Then it more or less disappeared from the news cycle and was confined to small, progressive circles on social media.It was another example of a pattern that has become familiar here: The government of Giorgia Meloni, Italys right-wing prime minister, does something that sparks an outcry among progressives and some media coverage, but fails to really outrage the wider public. The policy stays, Ms. Melonis ratings remain strong, and Italy inches to the right with little more than a shrug.",

And this election coincides with one of the greatest scientific turning points in human history: the birth of artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., which is likely to emerge in the next four years and will require our next president to pull together a global coalition to productively, safely and compatibly govern computers that will soon have minds of their own superior to our own.Donald Trump  who neglected to even appoint a science adviser until over 18 months into his presidency  is intellectually and temperamentally unsuited to assemble any such global alliance. His administration hastened a vaccine for Covid-19 with one hand and then fostered doubt about using it with the other when it met with a conservative anti-vaccine backlash.Today, Trumps first priority is not capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities that will come from America leading in the use of A.G.I. nor building a global coalition to govern it, but to impose higher tariffs on our allies to block their exports of cars and toys and other goods to the United States. The only technology Trump seems to be deeply interested in is Truth Social, his own version of X. Indeed, since Trump has described himself as a very stable genius, he probably doubts that there could even be an artificial intelligence greater than his own.Kamala Harris, given her background in law enforcement, connections to Silicon Valley and the work she has already done on A.I. in the past four years, is up to this challenge, which is a key reason she has my endorsement for the presidency.",

I came offstage feeling altered, as I so often do after performing Schumanns music  as if I had seen his innermost self and, in the process, accessed my own. Moments later, in the green room, I heard the questions Ive grown accustomed to but still steel myself against: Had Schumann already gone mad when he wrote this work? Can I hear the madness in the music?Schumann did indeed suffer from severe mental illness; he was institutionalized for the last years of his life. And there is no denying that as his condition worsened, the character of his music changed: It turned inward and grew increasingly static, still conveying his essence but somehow more aloof from the listener. And yet these questions always bother me. They reduce this beautiful, complicated, staggeringly gifted person to a pathology.More dangerously, they indicate a persistent and pernicious stereotype: the tortured artist. Think of the popular conception of the raging Beethoven, the anguished van Gogh, the volatile Caravaggio, the idiosyncratic Vladimir Horowitz, the guitar-smashing rock star.",

In 2020, misinformation and conspiracy theories flourished as vote counting dragged on in a handful of key battleground states. So for this Election Day it is critical that people know what to expect, the true nature of the likely delays and how some of them might have been prevented.Since 2020, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have either added rules that could slow down their vote counts, or allowed existing rules that contributed to long tabulating times in 2020 to remain in place. Only Michigan and North Carolina have meaningfully changed their laws to speed up the process. (Fortunately, Georgia historically counts quickly; Trump-aligned members of the state election board recently tried to impose rules that would have slowed the process down, but Georgias courts rejected the attempt.)The result is a patchwork of new developments and old laws  a few of which are encouraging, but many of which are troubling.

Yes. But that was the extent of his success that night. His overall message was dark, disturbing and as autocratic as you might expect from a man whose top officials have been warning us about his fascistic tendencies. Were running against a massive, crooked, malicious leftist machine thats running the Democrat Party, Trump said. They are smart and vicious, they are the enemy within, we must defeat them.Overshadowing the crude authoritarianism of Trumps remarks, however, were those of nearly every other speaker at the podium, who illustrated  each in his own way  the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the MAGA movement. There was, of course, the comedian from Texas who let loose a string of offensive jokes aimed at Blacks and Latinos, relishing the permissive atmosphere. Unfortunately for Trump, one of those jokes was an anti-Puerto Rican remark so racist that it galvanized some of the most prominent figures in Puerto Rican cultural life (This is what they think of us, Ricky Martin wrote in Spanish to his millions of followers on Instagram) and may have jeopardized the campaigns standing in Pennsylvania, where hundreds of thousands of Hispanic Americans of Puerto Rican descent live.",

In early May, Russian forces launched an offensive in Ukraines northeast, seizing several settlements in a push near the city of Kharkiv. In August, the Ukrainian Army crossed into Russias western Kursk region in a surprise assault that brought the war into the Russian territory in a way never before seen, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to evacuate.Away from the front, millions of Ukrainians have spent hours in bomb shelters as Russia rains down missiles and drones on military units and civilians across the nation. Ukraines energy grid, severely damaged, is working but sporadically. Thousands of schools, hospitals and cultural institutions have been damaged or destroyed.

He wants us to cut through our feet.Saw, which was released 20 years ago this week, was never supposed to be a success. It was meant as a low-budget calling card for two Australian film students who were looking to start their careers with a scrappy splash and a neat idea: a serial killer who forces his victims to prove they want to stay alive through bloody sacrificial tasks.Instead, it made more than 80 times its budget at the box office, created a horror villain for the new millennium and inspired the label torture porn, with each installment in the ensuing franchise ratcheting up the disgust.It can be hard to remember two decades later that the original Saw was less interested in gore than morality.What would you do to save your life, or someone elses? said the actor Shawnee Smith, summing up the central tension behind the franchises elaborate traps. In order to expediently escape the reverse bear trap enclosing her head in Saw, Smiths character is forced to locate a key inside another persons stomach.

James Wan and Leigh Whannell, film school classmates at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, had been looking to develop their first feature and kicked around ideas until one stuck. They wrote the script together and Wan directed.Wan, who has gone on to make big-budget Hollywood fare as well as unhinged horror flicks, like Insidious and Malignant, said Saw turned classic tropes on their heads.Oh, youve seen that? Oh, you think you know whats going to happen? Wan said from a dingy basement bathroom in London, a fitting homage to Saw and the only place he could get cellphone service while shooting the next installment of The Conjuring franchise there. Im going to try something else you havent seen before.The classic tropes within Saw  serial killers, haunted detectives, creepy puppets  are mashed together and inverted around the undeniable binary of its core choice.Unlike the winking meta horror fare that preceded it, including horror buff Scream teens and Rube Goldberg machinations in Final Destination, no amount of genre knowledge can save the characters of Saw from having to make an ultimate decision.The film critic David Edelstein described Saw and some of its peers  most notably Eli Roths Hostel (2005)  as torture porn in a 2006 New York magazine essay. But the first Saw is not especially gruesome when compared with the deaths punctuating this years Terrifier 3 and In a Violent Nature.To escape the reverse bear trap enclosing her head, Shawnee Smiths character is forced to locate a key inside another persons stomach. LionsgateSaw is more of a detective thriller with a gruesome twist. The titular tool acts as a rusty Chekhovs gun, while the desperation of the characters provides the terror.The franchises traps are devised by the character John Kramer (Tobin Bell), a terminally ill cancer patient who is angry at people for wasting their lives. Kramer, who would eventually be known as Jigsaw, is technically not a serial killer. Every victim is given the choice to live.Deep down inside, although he is of course somewhat ruthless in this approach, Johns in the business of saving souls, Bell said.That framework came out of Whannells personal experience with recurring migraines in his early twenties. While sitting in a waiting room before a CT scan, he wondered how the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor could change someone.The game seemed to be about time, Whannell, who also plays the second man trapped in the bathroom, said of the killers motives. Hes giving them this time limit and hes making them do these extreme things, like, How badly do you want to live?Saw did not have a simple path to creation. When it came time to actually make the movie, Australian financing fell through.Wan and Whannell were ready to scrape together money to film on the cheap, but Whannells manager, Stacey Testro, thought it could work in Hollywood, where she also had an office. Instead of sending her to court producers in the United States with just a script, the writers made a 10-minute short film of the reverse bear trap sequence with Whannell in the rig.Testro remembers watching the short in her living room, with her luggage by the door and a car out front waiting to take her to the airport. It was just thrilling, she said.Producers at Evolution Entertainment  Gregg Hoffman, Oren Koules and Mark Burg  were impressed enough to give Wan and Whannell a $700,000 shooting budget for the chaotic 18-day shoot, which cut costs by filming mostly in the bathroom set. Wan, who had previously focused on stop-motion animation, also handmade Billy the Puppet, an unsettling ventriloquist dummy with red spiral cheeks, a tricycle and the franchises most famous line, I want to play a game.Wan used papier-mch, table tennis balls for Billys eyes and cardboard boxes to fill out a child-size tuxedo for the body. (At first he also had a bowler hat, Wan said, but it looked slightly too silly.)The limited budget did not prevent the movies ideas from resonating with audiences.The first movie was all about ethics and how far can you go and whats right and whats wrong with humanity, Burg said, recalling that Evolution thought Saw would be its version of David Finchers Se7en (1995).Saw was influenced by Se7en, in which Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are detectives chasing a serial killer who punishes his victims with elaborate setups. New Line CinemaWhannell described his goal for Saw as a mix between Se7en and Cube. In Finchers movie, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are detectives chasing down a serial killer who models his murders after the seven deadly sins, punishing his victims via elaborate setups symbolic of their moral failings. In Cube (1997), an offbeat Canadian science fiction horror film, prisoners in a mysterious jail travel through rooms rigged with traps.The extended Saw franchise  the 11th film is scheduled to come out next year  has not always stuck to the ideas put forward by the first movie. Wan never directed another Saw movie, while Whannell contributed to Saw II and wrote the screenplay for Saw III.In the decades since Saw was released, Wan has directed tentpole franchise entries like Aquaman (2018) and Furious 7 (2015). Whannell has also settled into the directors chair, including The Invisible Man (2020) starring Elisabeth Moss and the upcoming Wolf Man, both modern incarnations of classic horror stories.That success all goes back to the two friends as fledgling filmmakers trying to find a story that felt compelling, and then landing on ethical choices with bloody results.Whannell is proudest of the Saw franchises outsize impact on popular culture. His favorite: In The Sopranos, a character becomes fixated on pitching a movie that he describes as Saw meets The Godfather Part II. Billy the Puppet was recently added to the popular battle royale video game Fortnite.Whether we wanted to or not, Whannell said, we basically created the millennial Freddy Krueger.",

Abdur-Rahim was 43.The school said in a statement that complications arose during his treatment at a Tampa-area hospital.All of us with South Florida Athletics are grieving with the loved ones of Coach Abdur-Rahim, athletic director Michael Kelly said in a statement. He was authentic, driven, and his infectious personality captivated all of Bulls Nation. Coach Abdur-Rahim leaves a lasting impact on our student-athletes, the University, and the community.AdvertisementAbdur-Rahim was seen as a rising star in the profession and a potential major program coach. He led a remarkable turnaround in his first season with the Bulls last year, earning unanimous American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year honors. He coached South Florida to a school-record 25 victories, its first regular-season conference title ever, its first appearance in the polls and its first NIT appearance in more than a decade.Before taking over the Bulls in March 2023, Abdur-Rahim, a Georgia native, guided Kennesaw State to 26 wins and its first trip to the NCAA Tournament after the program went 1-28 in his first season at the helm (2019-20).The Southeastern Louisiana graduate also spent time as an assistant at Georgia and Texas A&M.In a very short time, Coach Abdur-Rahim made an indelible impact on the University of South Florida, school president Rhea Law said. Throughout my time working with Coach Abdur-Rahim, I was continually inspired by his leadership, and truly admired his sincere approach to connecting with our entire student body. His influence on our student-athletes, coaching staff and the university community will live on forever.Corey Staniscia witnessed Abdur-Rahims influence and sincere connections firsthand as the director of the Bulls Fowler Ave Collective. Abdur-Rahim sent random supportive text messages. More than once, he hung around the campus Starbucks and put students drinks on his tab.The last time Staniscia saw him, he asked how the team was jelling. Abdur-Rahims answer: Im getting them to love each other.That man loved his athletes and what he did, Staniscia said. He truly did care about them.We couldnt have asked for a better person to be here.Abdur-Rahim is survived by his wife, Arianne Buchanan, and three children, Laila, Lana and Aydin. His older brother, Shareef, was a longtime forward in the NBA.Abdur-Rahims death comes less than a week before South Floridas scheduled exhibition against Edward Waters. The school did not announce an interim coach.(Photo: Chris Jones / Imagn Images)",

Stone-faced, the quarterback couldnt stop shaking his head in disbelief.I dont understand how we lost, he said.We should win that game, coach Lane Kiffin said.Ole Miss had already suffered a loss to Kentucky. This one landed harder.AdvertisementWe have followed a plan that was deliberate and intentional to make an effort to be in this first 12-team Playoff, said Walker Jones, the executive director of The Grove Collective. That started two years ago.It culminated this fall, Jones said, having invested more than $10 million into a roster loaded with talent and highly recruited transfers. Jones said that number likely ranks among the top half of SEC programs.No. 18 Ole Miss goal is still technically in reach, but the 29-26 overtime loss to LSU on Oct. 12 sharply steepened the odds. Among the remaining opponents this season is No. 2 Georgia. The Rebels host Oklahoma this Saturday.Name, image and likeness, with the NCAA forced by the courts to allow athletes to monetize it in 2021, quickly became the most important fuel for roster building in college sports endless arms race. Third-party collectives affiliated with schools became responsible for facilitating it, and Ole Miss was among the schools at the forefront of using the transfer portal to its advantage.GO DEEPER College football portal confidential: How tampering, NIL deals and portal chaos happenNow, even as the way of doing business is changing again amid the House v. NCAA settlement, and with Ole Miss saddled with two losses, it would be easy to decry the roster as money wasted, to point to a program that fell short of its goals.Jones has the same response to that sentiment he gave to countless donors during two years spent frantically fundraising.I dont know if were going to get to the Playoff, he said, days before the loss to LSU. But I know how were not gonna get there. Were not gonna get there if we dont invest in a plan and commit to it.Jones was a former Ole Miss team captain and linebacker from 1994 to 1997 who later worked as the director of sports marketing for Under Armour and became an agent. He founded his own business before agreeing to lead Ole Miss NIL collective in the middle of 2022.To educate the fan base and put a face on Ole Miss approach to NIL, he convinced athletic director Keith Carter to hold a news conference alongside him and Rebels coaches that fall. Despite alerting the SEC beforehand, that aggressive approach earned Carter a cautionary call from the conference afterward.AdvertisementOle Miss, Carter said, is intentional about being aggressive as a means of making up ground between it and competition with bigger budgets and that has had more success traditionally.The NIL world and compliance, its a lot about risk management now. How far do you think you should go? Can you go? Weve walked that tightrope pretty well. Weve been aggressive, Carter said. And weve done well with some of those calculated risks. And the playing field is leveled some with the new model.Jones built relationships with big-money donors and built a subscription platform for fans who could pledge only tens or hundreds of dollars a month.On the field, Dart was showing promise as a sophomore first-year starter. The winds of change were blowing heavily toward an expanded Playoff, making Ole Miss dreams of inclusion more within reach. That December, the 12-team Playoff to launch in 2024 became official.We made a decision with coach Kiffin and others that said, Hey, if were gonna get in that 12-team Playoff, we need to start now, Jones said. I stop short of saying all-in, Playoff-or-bust narrative. But it was an intentional and deliberate approach to put a team together this year to be one of those 12.Roster building means managing three worlds: high school recruiting, roster retention and, yes, the portal. The collective must work closely with the coaching staff.Kiffin quickly agreed to stay mostly uninvolved with how much players were making, Jones said, and The Grove Collective leaves coaches out of financial decisions and negotiations with players. Like most of the more well-funded collectives, The Grove Collective has its own system of metrics and analytics it uses to find valuations for individual players, based on their positions and the teams needs.In 2023, Ole Miss signed 23 prospects to land the nations No. 2 transfer class, according to 247Sports, building on what Ole Miss had already started when it also landed the No. 2 class in 2022. Only four teams signed more transfers, and Louisiana Tech transfer Tre Harris highlighted the class. Harris leads the nation in receiving and had a highlight touchdown catch in the loss to LSU before being sidelined by an injury.AdvertisementIn 2024, the Rebels added 25 more transfers to sign the nations top portal class, with Kiffin embracing his status as the sports Portal King. Five-star defensive lineman Walter Nolen came from Texas A&M to highlight the class alongside Florida edge rusher transfer Princely Umanmielen, Alabama corner transfer Trey Amos and South Carolina receiver transfer Antwane Wells Jr.In the first year, the collective, Jones said, spent far less on roster retention than in the next year. Key contributors wanted to be paid more for their efforts.The speed-dating aspect of recruiting the portal meant enlisting team leaders like Dart, Harris and 325-pound, two-way player JJ Pegues to vet players and sign off on the dynamics of bringing transfer players into the program after they visited campus.The market is settling, Jones said, but any good collective has to be nimble entering each new portal window as players, agents and collectives learn more about how to operate. And the portal works both ways.Star running back Quinshon Judkins announced in January he was leaving Ole Miss for Ohio State after rushing for more than 2,700 yards and 31 touchdowns the previous two seasons. Ohio State athletic director Ross Bjork told ESPN earlier this offseason the Buckeyes had $20 million to spend on their 2024 football roster.Jones and The Grove Collectives efforts in two short years have made waves. Kiffin said in a news conference earlier this year that former Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze had attempted to pull Jones from his alma mater to help Auburn operate its collective. Jones said he got a chuckle out of it.In September, Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek called out Arkansas fans at an event and said they needed to grow their numbers to be more like Ole Miss collective.AdvertisementNobody loves that Ole Miss is in the top five, right? No. We hate it, Yurachek told cameras and a crowd gathered at an event for program supporters.The Grove Collective boasts 6,000 paid subscribers, Jones said, a large portion of whom had never given to Ole Miss before the NIL era and are under 35.But the shocking home loss to Kentucky and the crushing defeat in Death Valley have caused the wheels underneath the fast start to wobble. What now?This isnt a one-shot wonder. Were going to continually build rosters that are relevant nationally and in the top 12 and trying to get into the Playoff every year, Carter said. If we dont get in the Playoff this year, it isnt over. Were just getting started.What that looks like in the future is still unfolding. The House v. NCAA settlement, granted preliminary approval earlier this month, could bring new rules and guidelines to roster management as soon as the summer of 2025.Some collectives might be brought in-house. Some might partner with schools. Some might stay independent but closely connected to the athletic departments they bolster. Each school will have to decide which model fits it best. The NCAA is looking to monitor true market value with a clearinghouse that would vet all NIL deals worth more than $600.Revenue sharing, a major result of the settlement, with schools paying players directly, is expected to be set at a little more than $20 million next year and will rise as television deals grow more valuable.The limited information we have is there will be two buckets of money: the revenue sharing thats mandated from the settlement and incremental, third-party, market-based NIL, Jones said. The second bucket, NIL, will be much harder to police and value, and there isnt going to be a cap to it. One school might say, Were gonna spend another $30 million on top of that rev share. Another school might say, Well, we only have $5 million we can spend.Jones and The Grove Collective want to make sure Ole Miss is closer to the first group than the second.(Photo of Ole Miss players Jamarious Brown, left, and Walter Nolen: Jonathan Bachman / Getty Images)",

Neither did the threat of fines: A violation carried a potential fine of up to $300, and hundreds of people received tickets each year.But after decades of mostly turning the other way, city officials finally decriminalized jaywalking, crossing against a traffic signal or outside a crosswalk.

            "text": "Let me apologize in advance for cheating a bit.We use the term breakout like its just spontaneous combustion, but thats rarely how it happens. Like most reactions, usually they require a catalyst. Thus, the inherent issue about calling a breakout in advance is that often the term isnt quite what were describing. Instead, the real breakout is one of opportunity, in the form of minutes and touches, rather than one of rapidly changing levels of play.AdvertisementFor example, check out last seasons Most Improved Player award winner, the Philadelphia 76ers Tyrese Maxey. Yes, he has made steady progress since his rookie year in 2020. But the big change for him last season wasnt about his own game; it was about the departure of James Harden days into the season. That transaction opened the door for Maxey to become Phillys primary on-ball initiator, increase his usage rate from 24.1 percent to 28.0 percent and up his scoring rate from 20.3 per game to 25.9.Youll find similar storylines littering the field when looking at my All-Breakout squad for this season, consisting of 11 players I think have a chance to significantly boost their production from a year ago.The Basketball 100 The story of the greatest players in NBA history. In 100 riveting profiles, top basketball writers justify their selections and uncover the history of the NBA in the process. The story of the greatest plays in NBA history. Pre-orderSo, back to the cheating  Ill also note that I cheated a second time since I already have 1/82 of the answers to the test. Its a little easier to come up with an All-Breakout Team when you already have a peek at how minutes and touches will work for most of these teams after a few days of games.That said, projecting breakouts can be a bit harder than it looks. Injuries, slumps and our misperceptions caused by our tiny human brains can easily send a potential breakout sideways. Take a gander at last seasons list, for instance.I had the Most Improved Player (Maxey), but none of the other 13 players who received votes made my list. I had Anthony Edwards, Chet Holmgren and Scottie Barnes on my team, all of whom genuinely broke out  but I also had LaMelo Ball and Mikal Bridges. And then theres Charlottes Mark Williams, who seemed like an easy call 12 months ago. He ended up playing 19 games.With that said, let me bravely charge ahead into my list for this year. I tried to represent every level of the playing spectrum, so along with a few players who are already big stars, I have some deep cuts in secondary roles.AdvertisementMy 11-man All-Breakout Team for 2024-25:This isnt just me riding the wave of Davis dominant opening night performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Hes low-key been on a heater for the last few months; Davis was one of the most productive players in preseason, even when most veterans throttle down to coasting speed, and was one of the best players on Team USAs gold-medal winning squad.Before that, he finished his 2023-24 regular season strong and was fantastic in the Lakers five-game, first-round defeat against the Denver Nuggets, averaging 27.8 points on 67 percent shooting and a playoff-leading 15.6 boards. Hes also, thankfully, playing full-time as a center, which is his most productive position even if he doesnt like it.Health and shooting will always be the swing variables for Davis, but hes off to a good start on those fronts as well  he even made an above-the-break 3 in the opener. The bar is high for a breakout here, but with 39-year-old LeBron James volume possibly on the downslope and few others capable of soaking up the extra chances, this could be a career year for Davis.GO DEEPER Anthony Davis gives Lakers an early dose of hope  and a long-awaited blueprintDyson Daniels, SG, AtlantaThis one isnt the usual case of a player breaking out because of an increase in touches and shots. This is a defensive breakout, where Daniels is being thrust into a role as the Hawks defensive stopper. He was a force at that end in New Orleans, but his role fluctuated because of a crowded backcourt and his iffy shooting, limiting him to 22 minutes per game across 61 appearances and just 17 total minutes in the playoffs.That wont be the case in Atlanta, where the Hawks have been desperate for an elite defender on the perimeter. The 6-foot-8, 21-year-old Daniels is starting and likely will see big minutes as along as his offense is at least somewhat threatening. If so, he has a great chance to lead the league in steals (he had five on opening night and was second in the NBA in steal rate a year ago) and a decent shot at cracking one of the All-Defensive teams.Zion Williamson, PF/C, New OrleansThis one is a pure eye-test call: Williamson finished last season playing the best basketball of his career. He was in the midst of destroying the Lakers in a Play-In game when his hamstring betrayed him. All that seems to have carried over to this year, where he looks fantastic in preseason  statistically, sure, but even more so physically, exploding past people as he did as a rookie and accumulating heaps of layups.AdvertisementAll of this is juiced by his expected positional move to center. Even if it isnt full-time, he should have enough reps at that spot that he can feast blowing past overmatched centers or compromising defenses as a rim-running screener if they try to match up smaller against him.Williamson missed the Pelicans opener with an illness, but that should be a quick absence. I dont know exactly how many games well see of this version of him, but Im excited about the possibility of seeing a full-ish season of peak Williamson. This feels like the season we might get it.GO DEEPER What's behind Zion Williamson's newfound drive? TrustAmen Thompson, positionless, HoustonBetween Wembymania and Thompsons early-season injury, the hype machine for the fourth pick in the 2023 draft never really got rolling. I think that might change this year, when Thompson has a greater chance to establish himself as a hybrid center-guard-not-sure-what-to-call-it dynamo who can blow up offenses with his switchy, twitchy athleticism and wreak havoc in transition at the other end.There are some barriers, as we saw on opening night. Thompson is coming off the bench, and his lack of shooting is exacerbated by a roster that already doesnt have much reliable spacing. He still has to become a more refined decision-maker to take advantage of his ballhandling and athleticism too. That said, Thompsons fine rookie season (18.2 PER, 57.6 percent true shooting, mammoth rebound and steal + block rates) largely went under the radar a season ago, and that doesnt figure to be the case this season on a Houston squad that should be a League Pass favorite.Josh Giddey, PG/SF, ChicagoGiddy only had a lukewarm opener against New Orleans feisty wing defenders, but Ill stay on the bandwagon here. He should fit in his role in Chicago much more easily than he did in Oklahoma City as an on-ball creator with limited shooting gravity. That should provide him more opportunity to grow in some of the other areas (drawing fouls, defense, catch-and-shoots, etc.), where his limitations dragged him down with the Thunder. Additionally, Chicagos situation should give Giddey a lot more opportunities to play through mistakes and develop on the floor.Not that hes chopped liver now. The 22-year-old is a plus passer and rebounder with an excellent floater game and good court vision, and for what its worth, hes also one of the best inbound passers in basketball. That hes also playing for a contract after he and the Bulls didnt reach an extension this past week is another reason to believe in him taking a big step up.GO DEEPER Why teams held the line at the extension deadline, and which clubs made out bestJalen Williams, SF, Oklahoma CityJust because its obvious doesnt mean it isnt true. The Thunder badly need a secondary shot creator to step up, especially with the aforementioned Giddey gone, and Williams is the clear candidate to soak up a lot of those touches and shots.Hes also shown the capability of being a player who can handle that added responsibility efficiently, as hes proven up to the challenge at each step of his development in his first two seasons with the Thunder. Again, its not just about the opportunity here, but about Williams having the talent to sustain a greater role on a winning team. For what its worth, Williams was awesome in his four preseason games, with a 30.1 PER on 66.3 percent true shooting.AdvertisementRJ Barrett, SF, TorontoIf a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears, it, does it makes a sound? What if, instead of a forest, its Canada?Barrett was already showing signs of turning a corner last season in New York, then played significantly better after the trade in Toronto. Nobody noticed because it happened in the general destitution of the Raptors 2023-24 season, but Barrett is becoming a dude.In 32 games as a Raptor, Barrett averaged 21.4 points per game and shot 60.5 percent on 2s. The eye test backed it up; there was more comfort and control in the finishing, more nuanced shot selection and distribution and even (gasp) the occasional right-handed attack.He built on that in the summer by arguably being Canadas second-best Olympian, averaging 19.8 points on blistering 70.1 percent true shooting. While we didnt see him in preseason due to a sprained AC joint, hes listed as day-to-day and expected to rejoin the action soon, so it shouldnt slow him down too much.Entering his age-24 season, on a roster with basically four real players and some serious question marks, Barrett should have plenty of room to explore his limits and continue refining his hard-charging downhill game.Tre Mann makes a move against Miles McBride and the Knicks. (John Jones / USA Today Network via Imagn Images)Tre Mann, SG, CharlotteMann is single-handedly trying to bring baggy back. Seeing him on the court in his 178-pound frame and size XXXXL jersey and shorts, it looks like one of those in-game promotions where they have kids put on an NBA players uniform then run around and try to score a basket.Mann, however, is pretty good at the latter part. He scored 24 points in Charlottes upset of Houston on opening night, continuing a positive stretch of basketball dating to his trade from the Thunder last spring. Mann was one of the leagues most effective players statistically in preseason, which does have some predictive value, and quietly averaged double figures in 28 games for the Hornets at the end of last season.AdvertisementThis was a bit of a surprise, as he had struggled to gain traction for three years in Oklahoma City, and its possible his lack of size for a two guard and limited playmaking for a point guard restrict him going forward. As with Giddey above, theres also a financial incentive. The Hornets could have extended Mann this past week (hes on the last year of his rookie deal) and instead opted to wait and gather more information.Julian Strawther, SF, DenverIm not even cheating on this one because the Nuggets hadnt played yet when I wrote this. But Strawther seems to be at the right nexus of opportunity and production. He was eighth in the NBA in preseason scoring, and the Nuggets desperately need him to fill a void in the wing rotation created by Kentavious Caldwell-Popes departure. He also has the specific skill set they most crave, as a high-volume 3-point shooter on a team that was last in 3-point rate a year ago.Strawthers rookie season with the Nuggets was mostly spent watching, and his NBA minutes didnt go all that well with an 8.2 PER and 29.7 percent 3-point shooting. However, the 22-year-old from Gonzaga has thrived in other settings  hes had two strong summer leagues in addition to his 2024 preseason  and small-sample shooting variance explains much of his poor stats from 2023-24.Cam Thomas green light, BrooklynIm not sure whether this qualifies as a genuine breakout or just something thats going to be fun as hell to watch. But if were talking about touches and opportunity? Sheesh. Thomas had 36 points on 27 shots opening night in Atlanta, and if you look at the Nets roster, that trend line seems likely to continue. Theres just nobody else on the team who can create shot volume like Thomas, and the volume will only increase if Brooklyn moves Dennis Schrders expiring contract.Thomas has always been a high-volume player, ranking sixth in the league in field goal frequency a year ago. However, the criticism was about quality, not quantity. In the past, there have been too many tough 2-point jumpers and little in the way of playmaking, both of which dragged down his efficiency. Thomas corrected some of that in the opener, getting off 13 3-point attempts and making seven, and interjecting at least a couple of passing reads that let you talk yourself into growth there.After 48 hours, he was third in the NBA in field goal attempts and second in scoring. With few other options on the Nets roster and operating in a contract year, Thomas may stay near the top of both columns all season.This isnt quite on Thomas level, but Powell is in a contract year and looks set to re-establish at least some of his value on a Clippers team that really needs his scoring. Or maybe, as a Cheers fan, I just like to yell out Norm! occasionally.AdvertisementEither way, Powell will be the second option next to James Harden for as long as Kawhi Leonard is out. When Leonard returns, Powell will likely revert to a sixth man role. A 17-point, four-assist opener in Phoenix is a good start for this trend line, and Powell did this while going 1 of 7 from 3 (hes a 39.4 percent career shooter from distance).Powell has the added benefit of no longer having to watch the Russell Westbrook show when he checks in with the Clippers subs. Instead, with Leonard injured and Paul George departed, it mostly will be his show any time Harden is off the floor. While Powell thrives best as a secondary scorer rather than a get-out-of-my-way guy, hell also have significant overlap with Harden where he can thrive off the ball. At age 31, he could end up threatening his career-high scoring average of 19.6 from back in Toronto.Sign up to get The Bounce, the essential NBA newsletter from Zach Harper and The Athletic staff, delivered free to your inbox.(Photo of Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson: Tyler Kaufman / Getty Images)",

            "text": "Shohei Ohtani has been a superstar in Japan for more than a decade, but one day earlier this year, a Tokyo resident named Tatsuo Shinke noticed something different.Shinke, the CEO of Mint, a leading trading card store, had already watched as Ohtanis soaring popularity had fueled the Japanese collectibles industry, spiked Japanese television ratings for Major League Baseball, and pushed baseball news into every corner and crevice of the countrys vast media ecosystem.AdvertisementYet as Ohtani made history in his first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming the first player in history to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in one season, Shinke observed another data point: His mother, Emiko.At 73 years old, Emiko had never followed baseball. But because Ohtanis Dodgers games are aired live in the morning in Japan, and because he has become a daily fixture on the countrys popular morning variety shows  the equivalent of Good Morning America or Today  Emiko developed a new morning routine: She wakes up, eats breakfast, and then turns on Ohtani.Elderly people in Japan love Ohtani, Shinke said. Its my mother. And all my mothers friends. Shes retired already, so she has enough time to watch all the games in the morning.In the United States, the World Series between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers is a matchup featuring the countrys two biggest cities and most high-profile franchises. The audience could surpass 20 million viewers per game for the first time since 2016.In Japan, it will likely be even bigger.In seven seasons in the majors, including six for the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani has lorded his talent over Major League Baseball in a manner previously thought impossible. For his trouble, he has captured two Most Valuable Player awards while dominating as a hitter and a pitcher. If he wins his third this November, as is expected, he will become the first full-time designated hitter to win the award, a role he was forced to play after injuring his elbow last season.At World Series Media Day on Thursday, no one was a bigger draw than Ohtani. (Katharine Lotze / Getty Images)In America, his performance earned him a $700 million contract  the largest in history  and stardom in a sport that increasingly trails its rivals in cultural capital. But back home in Japan, where baseball is the most popular sport, Ohtanis celebrity has reached stratospheric levels, akin to Michael Jordan or David Beckham, figures who transcended their field of play and whose fame turned them into international avatars for their home country.AdvertisementThere isnt a person in Japan who doesnt know who Ohtani is, I dont think, said Robert Whiting, an American author in Tokyo who has written about Japanese baseball since the 1970s.When the Dodgers defeated the Padres in Game 5 of the National League Division Series  a game that featured two Japanese starting pitchers  an estimated audience of 12.9 million Japanese viewers tuned in at 9 a.m. on a Saturday, at least 5.4 million more than watched in the U.S. When Ohtani chased 50-50 in September, his exploits often led the national nightly news and daytime wide shows, spaces that rarely mention sports. (The business newspaper Nikkei also ran a front-page story above the fold.) And when Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, spoke of Ohtani during a press conference in Tokyo earlier this season, he told reporters he wanted to speak not as an ambassador but as a kid from Chicago who watched Jordan rule the 1990s and transcend basketball.This is early on in Ohtani-sans career, Emanuel said, but theres no doubt that thats what he has right now.The sheer volume of wall-to-wall coverage has even surprised Whiting, who first moved to Tokyo in the 1960s and has authored books on baseball and Japanese culture. Japan has seen this story before, the obsession over conquering baseball heroes in the form of Hideo Nomo, Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui, who was World Series MVP for the Yankees in 2009. But perhaps not since Nomo in the 1990s, Whiting says, has a Japanese player embodied and lifted the national spirit.When Nomo debuted for the Dodgers in 1995  in the middle of a nasty trade dispute between the United States and Japan  Whiting recalled that Asahi Shimbun, one of the nations biggest newspapers, ran an editorial stating: In Hideo Nomo, the Japanese have produced a product that no one is complaining about. But whereas Nomo, Suzuki and later pitchers like Yu Darvish validated the quality of Japanese baseball, Ohtani has changed the equation: For the first time, Japanese fans can credibly argue that the most talented baseball player of all time is from Japan.AdvertisementIn the global market, Japanese value and power is (becoming) a little bit weaker, year by year, said Tomoki Negishi, a baseball marketing executive who worked for Japans Pacific League. So Ohtani-sans great performance is a beacon.To some, he says, Ohtani is a symbol of Japan in the global market.To others?He is just a crazy superhero that Ive never seen before, Negishi says.On the morning of October 12, the symbol beamed through a television into a living room in ta, a special ward in Tokyo. Masanori Ninomiya, an owner of an English reading company, finished a traditional breakfast of white rice, miso soup and fruit and then turned on the Dodgers and Padres.Ninomiya, 59, grew up in the city of Oita, obsessing over books about Japanese baseball history. He attended business school at UCLA in the 90s, as Nomo was breaking through. He is among those in Tokyo who work remotely, which allows him to put the Dodgers on in the background during the work week.Everybody will have a breakfast, he said And then its Ohtani.In Japan, all Dodgers games appear on NHK, the countrys free, over-the-air public broadcaster. The audience for NHK often skews older, especially in the mornings. Unlike the United States, where European soccer fans huddle in bars and pubs in the morning, there is less public consumption of Ohtani, outside of major events like the World Baseball Classic. According to Negishi, this is partly due to cultural norms and partly because of the sheer volume of baseball games.Im sure Im not the only one, said Chen Liang, director of imports at Mint cards and collectibles. But theres a huge percentage of Japanese people who are at work, and theyre in front of their computer, and theyre just clicking on the box score while they look at Excel sheets and things like that.AdvertisementNinomiya was awed by Ohtani when he emerged as a two-way player for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. He followed him when he debuted with the Angels in 2018, when the morning ritual began. But he ascribes the national love affair to the way Ohtani has conducted himself on the MLB stage.For example, if theres garbage on the ground, he tries to pick it up, Ninomiya said. We know hes a superstar  and super rich  but he doesnt behave like that.Ohtani and his representatives have cultivated an image in Japan of a modest, polite baseball star who is deferential to teammates and respectful to elders. The reputation helped Ohtani weather a wave of public scrutiny earlier this year, when his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was charged with stealing more than $16 million from an Ohtani bank account to cover gambling debts. (Mizuhara later pleaded guilty.) Its also helped him land a raft of endorsements from companies on both sides of the Pacific and turn his personal life into daily fodder on television. (His wife, Mamiko Tanaka, and his dog, translated to Dekopin in Japanese, are regular characters on the daytime shows.)The comings and goings of Mamiko Tanaka and Ohtani are regular fodder for Japanese morning shows. (Stringer / Getty Images)Those are traits that I think Japanese fans love to see in practice on a foreign land, said Hiroshi Kitamura, an associate professor of history at William & Mary who specializes in U.S.-East Asian relations. Japanese fans love to see MLB players like (Aaron) Judge, (Fernando) Tatis, (Ronald) Acuna say great things about Ohtani as being the unicorn. But I think they also appreciate seeing Ohtani kind of being Japanese. In that sense, I think Japanese fans see Ohtani as part of them.The face of Major League Baseball greeted Foster Griffin each day when he arrived in Tokyo. The billboards. The cardboard likenesses in convenience stores. Ohtanis voice even features in advertisements on the subway.Soon after Griffin, a former Kansas City Royals pitcher, moved to Japan to pitch for the Yomiuri Giants, he learned the cultural primacy of televised nightly news.And he has his own section of the news, Griffin said. They highlight everything he does every day over there. Hes everywhere.AdvertisementFrom an American perspective, its hard to conceive of the popularity of Ohtani in Japan. America does not revere any foreign sports in which they are not supreme. The Japanese media, a sprawling apparatus with five commercial television networks and five national daily newspapers, can be impenetrable for non-Japanese speakers. And contrary to hyperbole, not everyone in Japan cares about baseball.Culturally, I felt like in recent years, the interest of young kids seemed headed to new sports like soccer, said Ema Ryan Yamazaki, a Japanese filmmaker raised in Osaka.The sport, however, remains a cultural unifier, a source of connection at the office or during the morning commute. And Ohtani has transcended demographics, spawning new generations of fans while appealing to retired grandmothers in Tokyo, Fukuoka and Sapporo.In Japan, Ohtani is the face of countless advertising campaigns. (Tomohiro Ohsumi / Getty Images)The school teacher understands a balk and an intentional walk, throughout the entire country, said Bobby Valentine, the former Mets manager who had two stints in Japan as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines. Its like a port of passage. Baseball allows you to be acceptable in the culture. Its just one of those things.When Ohtani led the country to a World Baseball Classic championship last year, more than 42 percent of Japanese households watched Japan defeat the United States at 8 a.m on a Wednesday. Six of Japans seven WBC games drew more than 30 million viewers. Ohtanis presence  along with starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto  could help the Japanese World Series audience approach those heights. The numbers are already so striking that MLB continues to target the Japanese market, and will open the 2025 season with the Dodgers facing the Chicago Cubs in Tokyo, a year after the Dodgers opened the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres. Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Athletic this week that If youre going to open (the season) in Tokyo, the only choice was to take the Dodgers again. And the reason its the only choice is the audiences that those games deliver are so big that it drives whats a real broadcast business for us in Japan.The first pitch of the World Series will come at 9:08 a.m. on Saturday, airing on both NHK and commercial network Fuji TV. Interest is so high that creators of the wildly popular manga show One Piece pushed back a season premiere, to not compete with Ohtani.Smart move to move the show on their part, Yamazaki said. I would, too.AdvertisementAs Ninomaya puts it, the only figure in Japan who could conceivably surpass Ohtani in name recognition is the prime minister, and the current one, Shigeru Ishiba, just took office earlier this month.Some young people may not know our prime minister, he said. But even kids  junior high school students, senior high school students  everybody knows Ohtani.Yes, every generation in Japan is ready for breakfast with Ohtani. Even if there is one that appears most charmed.Earlier this year, Whiting, 82, was talking to his wife, Machiko Kondo, who worked for years as a resettlement officer at the United Nations. For decades, Kondo never expressed any interest in baseball, even as Whiting wrote best-selling books about Japanese baseball history and the meaning of Ichiro, even as he followed games on both sides of the Pacific.But then came Ohtani.Ive written all these baseball books that have gotten national attention, and it doesnt mean anything to her, Whiting said. But now with Ohtani, shes started asking: Did Ohtani have any home runs?The Athletics Andy McCullough and Sam Blum contributed to this story(Illustration: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; Photos: Jayne Kamin-Oncea / Getty Photos)",

Hes already awake, driving through the predawn darkness, pulling into an empty parking lot at 21300 Coach Gibbs Dr. The routine he started his final year at LSU has become a staple of his rookie season in the NFL.AdvertisementYou always here this early? Adam Peters asked after bumping into Daniels in the hallway around 5:30 a.m. a few weeks ago. Peters, the Commanders first-year general manager, was headed to the weight room. Daniels was about to watch some film.Usually, its a little earlier, Daniels told him. But I had to make an extra stop today.Peters looked down. Daniels was holding two boxes of donuts, gifts for his offensive linemen.For a while, his teammates didnt know he was showing up so early; Daniels studies with the door shut and doesnt tell anyone hes there. But in time, the car that kept beating them to the building, day after day, week after week, started to tell them something. A few started to wonder: is it normal for a quarterback to show up this early?Not normal for most, says linebacker Bobby Wagner, a 13-year veteran bound for the Hall of Fame. Normal for the great ones.After Washington took Daniels second in Aprils draft, the teams new center, Tyler Biadasz, figured hed start coming in early to work with the rookie on exchanges. He showed up at 6 one morning and realized he was late. Daniels was already on the practice field, repping that days walkthrough. Alone.GO DEEPER Jayden Daniels' growth with VR simulation has Commanders embracing mind gamesTerry McLaurin knew after his first practice. Daniels hadnt been on the field 15 minutes  hadnt been in the building a week  and he was already making checks at the line of scrimmage. Then the rookie made a throw that cut through the teeth of the defense, a throw McLaurin remembers in detail five months later.Heres why this play is different, the sixth-year Pro Bowl wideout says. The receivers running a crosser, and most guys wait to release it until he clears the hook defender in the middle of the field. They wait until that window opens up, you know?Jayden threw it before there even was a window. Ive never seen a rookie do that.AdvertisementLinebacker Frankie Luvu was on the field that day. He saw the throw. He knew, too.We gotta get our s right on defense, he told himself, because we got ourselves a quarterback.A quarterback? This team? After churning through 27 starters and 10 coaches during the Dan Snyder era  winning just two playoff games in 24 years  as one of the NFLs proud franchises dissolved into dysfunction?There were league investigations and Congressional hearings. Leaked emails. The name change. The railing collapse. RGIIIs knee. Cover-ups. Lawsuits. And losing. Years and years of losing.Ive seen this place from afar, and there was always this black cloud over it, says Washington tight end Zach Ertz, who spent eight-plus years beating up on the franchise as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles. This was an organization that always had talent, but you were never worried about them long-term.With new leadership, a guy like Jayden, the right group around him  this city has waited for this.Still, this is a scarred franchise and a scarred fan base trying to shake that lingering fear thats been beaten into them for 30 years.Paul Walker is 65. Hes wearing a burgundy Sonny Jurgensen No. 9, tailgating ahead of the Commanders Week 7 meeting with the Panthers. My first game in person since the Monday Night Massacre, he says, referring to the night 14 years ago when Eagles quarterback Michael Vick torched Washington for six touchdowns in a 59-28 win. We always got that mentality that somethings eventually gonna go wrong. It just always has.But Im telling you, this season is bringing me back to the Joe Gibbs years. Our quarterback might be the best one weve had since Walker pauses, then points to his chest, to Jurgensens No. 9.Rob Abelman fell in love with football during the Gibbs years. He used to tag along with his dad to games at RFK Stadium, and he watched two Super Bowl wins in person. Then he got so fed up with the team during Snyders run that he canceled his season tickets.AdvertisementThe minute he read Snyder was selling the team, he signed up for new ones. I have the belief because Ive seen it, says Abelman, who with his son, Jared, drives in from Philadelphia for games. (Jared) doesnt. Hes 24. All hes known his whole life is heartbreak.Sunday spoke to both. A 40-7 romp over Carolina  the NFC East-leading Commanders fifth win in six weeks  was tinged by Daniels first-quarter exit. Its a rib injury, not expected to be anything serious, but a reminder nonetheless for a fan base trying to convince itself its allowed to believe again.Hope remains a dangerous thing in the District.It started with an arena league quarterback drilling his dropbacks on an empty field just west of the San Bernardino Mountains. Ryan Porter was mid-sweat when Jay Daniels walked out of the YMCA across the street, recognized him, and asked if hed ever considered coaching. Porter shook his head.But I guess I could, he finally said.Cool, well be here tomorrow, Jay told him. I have a son who plays quarterback.By that point, Jay had pushed his 12-year-old to think about a different position. Jayden was long and lean, always the fastest kid on the field. What about wide receiver? dad would ask. Or cornerback? Jay had played the latter in college, first at Washington, then Iowa State, and to him it was merely a numbers game. Way more opportunities to get on the field, hed argue.The conversation kept coming up. The two kept going back and forth.Dad, Jayden always shot back, Im a quarterback.He was hell-bent, his father says now.So it was settled. Jay wouldnt fight his sons ambitions; hed nurture them.The first thing he did was warn Jayden. Youre gonna have to live in chaos, dad said. If you can live in chaos, then you can do this. Theyd spend hours on YouTube, poring through old games, studying some of the best to ever play the position. Jay wanted his son watching Joe Montana, because Joe Montana never lost his cool. Look at his face, hed tell Jayden. His expression never changes.AdvertisementA hard lesson came early, and it stuck: Jayden was 7, playing defense in the Pop Warner championship, and he was beat around the edge for a touchdown. He looked up at his father, about to burst into tears. Dont cry, Jay pleaded. Its just one play.He knew if the teams best player lost it, everyone else would, too. The tears spilled out. The whole team followed. The game was never close after that, Jay says.That afternoon  and what it taught Jayden  has stayed with him ever since. He built an unflappability into his game, refusing to get rattled. He knows teammates are watching, and teammates will follow.Seven games into his career, Jayden Daniels leads the NFL in completion percentage (75.6) and ranks sixth in passer rating (107.0). (Patrick Smith / Getty Images)Jay had always been a football junkie; his son became one too. Theyd watch college games on Saturdays and the NFL on Sundays. Theyd watch day after day of the scouting combine, then the entire NFL Draft. Porter, who would work with Jayden through high school, learned something early on: this wasnt just a hobby, and it wasnt just a sport.I call it an unhealthy obsession, the coach says. Not one time did Jayden ask, Hey, are my two hours up? He was there to get better. He was never bored. He was just in love with this thing called quarterback.Jay would send over videos from Jaydens U-14 games. OK, we got the zone read and RPO bubble down, hed write. Whats next? Porter realized he could teach Jayden a drill and never have to repeat himself. Hed see a nod, hear Mmmhmmm and nothing more.During workouts, Porter worked the feet more than he worked the arm. The smooth dropbacks Jayden employs now in burgundy and gold  the big five, rhythm five, flash give, seven step, one-step bounce  were first honed on that empty field across from the San Bernardino YMCA. Jayden saw progress through thousands of reps.Your eyes control your feet, and your feet control your arm, Porter kept telling him. He never once tinkered with Jaydens mechanics. He saw no need. Its like a slingshot, Porter says. Throwing a football for somebody like Jayden Daniels is a very natural thing. The minute I make it unnatural, Ive failed him as a coach.AdvertisementJaydens talents blossomed at Cajon High in San Bernardino, where his parents had to sign a waiver to allow him to play varsity as a freshman. He was maybe 130 pounds, Jay says. The Cowboys were state champs three years later. From there the spotlight began to swell, just as Jay had warned, and Jayden wrestled with the rigors of being a star quarterback. The pressure mounted his senior year: Everyone wanted five touchdowns a game, another state title, and, most of all, his college decision.Jay saw it on his sons face at halftime of Cajons playoff opener that fall. Jayden was playing lousy. He looked overwhelmed. Walking into the locker room, coaches kept pulling him aside, pointing out mistakes. The weight of it all, the hype, the expectations  he was a 17-year-old kid shouldering too much.Say something to him, Jay told Porter, who by that point was an assistant at Cajon.So while Jayden warmed up before the third quarter, Porter pulled out his phone and showed him a picture. In it, Jayden was 12 years old, smiling ear to ear, doing his favorite thing in the world: playing football. Forget all this BS right now, Porter told him. I just need you to be this kid.While Jayden stared at the photo, a tear trickled down his cheek. He threw three touchdowns after halftime. Cajon won 39-7 and made its way back to the state title game.While he weighed where to transfer after three years at Arizona State, Jayden Daniels told his dad, If I cant make it at LSU, then I dont deserve to be in the NFL one day. (Scott Winters / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Three years later, another decision beckoned: after a sterling start at Arizona State, Daniels struggled as a junior, tossing as many interceptions (10) as touchdowns. What few knew at the time: how much heartache hed been forced to bottle up inside.The winter before, in a span of three weeks, he lost two grandparents to COVID-19. His grandfathers passing hit hardest: Jays dad had passed football down to him, and Jay had passed it down to Jayden. Jayden and his grandfather had spoken the night before. I love you, his grandpa told him. Itd be the last thing Jayden ever heard him say.AdvertisementMan, that took a toll on both of us, his father says now. He carried a heavy load that season.Meanwhile, the NCAA was digging into ASUs program for alleged recruiting violations. Herm Edwards, the former NFL coach Daniels had come to Tempe to play for, was on his way out. The quarterback sought a bigger stage to finish his college career and an offense better suited to his strengths. He decided to transfer. His phone started blowing up.Daniels decided he wouldnt demand the starting job at his next stop, and his top choice, LSU, wasnt offering it. Hed arrive as the fourth QB on the depth chart.Jay stepped aside and let his son make the decision.High risk, high reward, Jayden told him. If I cant make it at LSU, then I dont deserve to be in the NFL one day.Youre gonna hate me, Sherman Wilson texted him.It was December 2022. Daniels had decided to return to LSU for his fifth and final college season, and Wilson, the Tigers director of player retention, wanted him to know what the next few months were going to look like.Wilson had been goading the quarterback for weeks while he weighed entering the draft. If you wanna be a fourth-round pick, fine, Wilson wrote at one point. But you have more to do here.Once Daniels decided to stay, Wilson became his corner man, Bundini Brown in his ear. Instead of shouting at him ringside, Wilson texted incessantly. Bible verses. Motivational stories. Barbs to seep under Daniels skin. Wilson knew he hadnt come close to reaching his potential in Baton Rouge.You succeed in September by preparing in January, Wilson wrote.Dont act like you wanna be the best if youre not willing to do what others arent.I hope youre ready, because youre not gonna see your family after spring break.For Daniels, everything changed. Hed think like a pro, study like a pro, work like a pro. The first thing he did was sit down with LSUs coaching staff and tick through a series of questions he wanted answered. Among them: Whats the detailed plan of how were going to win a national championship? And: What do I need to do to turn myself into a first-round pick?AdvertisementThe coaches looked around the room. They already had Daniels next few months mapped out, but for the quarterback to show this type of initiative? They knew what was coming. They knew he was about to take over.He put everything into that offseason, says Joe Sloan, LSUs QB coach at the time.A nutritionist cooked Daniels meals and helped him pack on 15 pounds. He started nightly throwing sessions with his top two receivers, Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr., that would last until 10 p.m. In the mornings, Daniels and Wilson would race to the building for 5 a.m. film sessions. Eventually, the quarterback started showing up so early they had to change the keycodes on the door.By the fall he was the best player in college football.Then, one night in November, his season nearly slipped away. A nasty hit knocked Daniels out of the Tigers road loss to Alabama. Im shaking it off! he shouted at Wilson in the medical tent. I gotta finish this! But the staff wouldnt let him. One play, and one concussion, threatened to upend his pursuit of the Heisman Trophy.He texted Wilson around 4 a.m. Theyll probably give it to him, Daniels wrote, referring to Washington QB Michael Penix Jr., Daniels chief competition for the award.Sounds like youre quitting, Wilson wrote back, tapping into Daniels competitive juices.Im not quitting. Just stating the obvious.If youre gonna pack it in, fine.F that, Daniels wrote.The two were in the film room at 5 a.m. on Monday. This is the week thatll define your career, Wilson told him.Daniels couldnt drive, so Wilson picked him up. Daniels was still in concussion protocol, so Wilson used his own fingerprint to get them in the building. The QB watched film of Floridas defense with sunglasses on, his hoodie pulled tight and the door shut. Nobody knew we were there, Wilson says. Daniels barely practiced that week but cleared protocol in time to start.Turns out, the Heisman race wasnt over. Daniels lit up the Gators for 606 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns in a 53-35 rout. A month later he stood on stage in New York City, trophy in hand.Daniels thought his chance at the Heisman disappeared after he was knocked out of a loss to Alabama late in the season. (Rich Graessle / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)On draft night four months later, Daniels waited one pick to hear his name called. Hed been No. 1 on Washingtons board all along, ahead of Caleb Williams, who went first to the Bears. You put in all the work in the early mornings, the late nights, Peters told him over the phone. I couldnt be more proud to pick you to represent our franchise.AdvertisementThen Peters handed the phone over to Dan Quinn. The coach was more direct: Were gonna kick a lot of ass together.Wilson texted a few days later, wanting Daniels thoughts on his new team.Were going to the playoffs, Daniels wrote back.Wilson shook his head  the kid was nothing if not ambitious. But this wasnt college football. The rookie needed to temper his expectations. Brother, this is the NFL, Wilson wrote. This is different.Daniels wouldnt budge.No, listen to me, he replied. Were going to the playoffs.They meet at 9 a.m. every Saturday, an hour before the rest of the team has to be in the building. Inside the room, its just the quarterbacks and skill position players. The 23-year-old rookie stands at the front, running through the 10 or 12 scripted plays the offense plans to open the game with a day later. Daniels reminds them of the audibles he can check into and the coverage beaters hell be looking for.Weve never had meetings like that here, McLaurin says. Not since Ive been here.Kliff Kingsbury, Washingtons first-year offensive coordinator, designed his system around Daniels dual-threat ability  The way he runs, it takes the soul of your defense, Peters gushed on draft night  without putting too much on the rookies shoulders. A heavy dose of short, timing-based throws are mixed in with a stout run game and the occasional deep shot, a healthy balance the young passer can manage. Seven games in, the Commanders are third in scoring (30.1 points per game) and Daniels leads the league in completion percentage (75.6).Marcus Mariota, Daniels backup, says the discipline of his decision-making is rare for a rookie, especially one drafted this high. There are certain expectations that greet a first-round quarterback the minute he walks through the door, expectations Mariota  the No. 2 pick in 2015  knows well. Too many chase highlight plays, Mariota says, the ones they built their name on in college.AdvertisementSo many times young guys in this league are trying to impress people, he says. They wanna extend plays and live up to their draft spot. Jaydens very much, Ill take what you give me. And if you give me the big one, Ill take that, too.'Sloan, now LSUs offensive coordinator, has followed Daniels rookie season closely. Nothings surprised him. He cant help but laugh when he thinks back to the question he kept getting from NFL evaluators last spring. They all wanted to know if Jayden Daniels was ready to be a pro.Listen, Sloan kept telling them, hes already a pro.(Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images)",

            "text": "25 Jump Scares That Still Make Us Jump The floor creaks, the music turns ominous and an uneasy quiet sets in. Then BAM! Its the classic jump scare. This staple of horror movies, when done well, is instantly memorable. With Times film writers, filmmakers and stars weighing in, we ranked the 25 jump scares that still get us every time. WARNINGThis article contains spoilers and may include intense scenes that could be disturbing for some readers.David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker on the Buildup in Seven When a rotting figure gasps for breath, the reaction of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and John C. McGinley was so convincing, it spawned a modern myth: that they werent told the body was an actor, not a prop. As it turns out, the stars did know (sorry, internet!), but the fact that the myth persists is a testament to the potency of the scene. In an email, the director, David Fincher, credited the screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker: Andy wrote it  it was a great idea  so I filmed it. The police pull back a grimy sheet to reveal a decomposing body ... ... Brad Pitts detective isnt so sure what hes seeing ... ... and when John C. McGinleys SWAT leader leans over the body, they all get a shock. But in an interview, Walker insisted it was Fincher and the prosthetics and makeup master, Rob Bottin, who turned his vision into a grisly jump scare, one that shouldnt have worked because it was absolutely expected. It was so much more a build, an exciting and almost clichd action scene that kind of slowly turns, Walker said. Their goal was to take the audiences expectation of the cavalry riding in, then to get a buzz saw to the face.  Maya Salam Stream it hereJennifer Kent on the Soundscape in The Babadook A bedroom door slowing creaking open. The scuffling of what sounds like cockroaches. A gravelly voice uttering the dreaded Babadook, dook, dook. And Amelia, a mother whos mentally unraveling, trembling under a blanket. In The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent, the soundscape is both classic haunted house and modern nightmare. The scene was intended to mimic what anyone would feel lying in bed as footsteps approach. All the sound is sucked out of the moment, Kent said in an interview. Its like we become hyper-aware. I hoped to draw the audience in and have them become her. Kent didnt follow tradition and incorporate most sound in postproduction. What I tend to do is make sure that the sound is in there, enough temporary sound is in there to make sure all this visual stuff works, she explained. So its very important to rhythm. Cutting a film is much closer to music than many people probably realize.  Maya Salam Stream it hereINTERLUDE Dont Underestimate the Power of a Jump Scare By Jason Zinoman After seeing Lon Chaneys monstrous face unmasked in the 1925 silent The Phantom of the Opera, a 9-year-old Robert Bloch peed his pants and became hooked on horror. He also grew up to write the novel Psycho, the source for the movie with a jump scare so effective it transformed, for many, the experience of taking a shower. Jump scares are considered the fart jokes of horror: cheap, easy and lowbrow. But that gives short shrift to a long, potent legacy. Of course, they can be crude, overdone and shoehorned in, but they can also be refined, mysterious and emotionally integrated. And as Chaney demonstrated a century ago, even the simplest ones have a power that should not be underestimated. The stakes are high because success is binary: A jump scare produces a jolt or it doesnt work. That puts a premium on novelty. You cant just place another figure in a rotating mirror and expect shudders. Its been done too many times. To really unsettle, you must subvert expectations, add misdirection, a wilder image, perhaps a disorienting sound cue. More ingenuity goes into certain jump scares than entire movies. Far from simple to pull off, a truly great one is a feat of pure cinema. Jump scares have an advantage online, where context shifts rapidly. They can not only work independently of the movie, but also sometimes find a more popular second life outside it. In recent years, a canon has emerged, picked apart and debated by fans yet inspiring to filmmakers. In a genre more crowded than ever, where every kind of abrupt shift of camera angle, music cue or creepy image seems to have been employed to find a new way to shock, jump scares have become increasingly elaborate. At their best, they are ambitious set pieces, operating like showstoppers in musicals. The director James Wan is a contemporary master of the art, and one of his most bravura examples is from The Conjuring (2013), a haunted house movie in which Lili Taylor is terrorized by a clapping sound in the cellar. Patiently established over several scenes, this ingeniously startling fright involves no special effects or monsters. Theres a bouncing ball, two hands and the oldest scare of all: fear of the dark. The result doesnt just judder nerves. Like the most thrilling art, it rattles you into seeing old things anew while reordering your sense of the possible.",

Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesThat is who Donald Trump is, but that is not who we are.If there is one line to take away from Kamala Harriss Tuesday night speech, not far from the White House, that seems like a good choice. With it, the vice president sought to remind us of the chaos and confusion that cling to the former president like slime on a shoe, while expressing the hope that Americans still have faith in themselves, and in one another, to demand better.That, more than anything, is what Harris was selling in her closing argument to that curious collection of voters still on the fence in this presidential race: A way to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the chaos and the division of Trumpism.As high-stakes speeches go, this one was solidly constructed and solidly delivered. Harris isnt an Obama-level orator, whether were talking Barack or Michelle. She acknowledged that many voters still dont feel that they know her well, and this appearance most likely didnt help much with that. It was loaded with platitudes and with sentimentality that wasnt quite personal enough to be moving or illuminating: Raised in a middle-class family. Instinct to protect the little guy. Always listen to you. Always tell you the truth. Never stop fighting for you. Build consensus. We need to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms? Oof.Once she got rolling, though, Harris did spend some time drawing distinctions between what she would do and what Trump would do, including: On Day 1, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. A little cheesy? Sure. But totally accurate, and the presence of the Oval Office right over her shoulder made it real.She then ran through her plans to help make homeownership more accessible, to fight for an expanded child tax credit, to invest in the caregiving economy  complete with a nice shout out to the struggling sandwich generation. In discussing immigration, she mentioned border security first thing. She vowed to fight for the reproductive rights stripped away by Trumps handpicked Supreme Court justices, and she talked up the need for a strong military.This reads like a down-to-earth, bread-and-butter to-do list  with a little something for everyone, and a little something for everyone to hate. Did she dig into the specifics of any of her proposals? No, she did not. This was neither the time nor the place.Harriss top job was to remind everyone what is at stake in this election. Of course, more than perhaps anything she said, her choice of setting drove that point home: the Ellipse at the south end of Presidents Park, the very place where the Jan. 6 riot took form as Trump whipped his supporters into a frenzy before unleashing them on the Capitol.Say this about the Trump era, it has taught everyone the value of political theater.It doesnt have to be this way, Harris reminded us.In another week, well see if shes right.",

Before practice, during training camp and in the halftime locker room, they are a favorite of players across the NFL, a touch of childhood wrapped in plastic.A few years ago The Athletic wrote about orange slices, the NFLs secret halftime snack (fun fact: teams are required to provide three dozen sliced oranges for halftime for the visiting team). But in the course of reporting that story, many players said they passed on halftime citrus in favor of something else: Uncrustables, the sealed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches found in the frozen aisle of your local supermarket  and apparently permeating the NFL.AdvertisementAt the end of the 2023 season, The Athletic endeavored to find out just how many Uncrustables the league actually eats. And after convincing team employees that this was in fact a real question and not another scam message, most teams agreed to pony up their data from last year. A handful declined to participate, and a few others said they were PB&J purists who made their own sandwiches.But based on the information collected, its safe to say that NFL teams go through anywhere from 3,600 to 4,300 Uncrustables a week. When you factor in training camps and the teams that did not share their data, NFL teams easily go through at least 80,000 Uncrustables a year.Weekly Uncrustable consumption across the NFL DEN 700 SEA 320 JAX 315 MIA 300 ATL 250 NYG 240 PIT 225 ARI 200 MIN 200 LAC 200 BAL 150 WAS 140 CLE 120 CAR 100 TEN 100 CHI 100 IND 90 LAR 90 KC 80 DAL 75 TB 70 LV 60 CIN 50 NO 50 Note: 24 of 32 NFL teams provided The Athletic with approximate ranges for weekly Uncrustables eaten.

Sometime in the mid-90s, Len said, his wife, Emily, suggested he create a mass-produced peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the crust.The project appealed to Lens business instinct: a simple idea with a complex logistical problem to solve. The Kretchmans started in their kitchen with a loaf of bread, one jar of peanut butter, one jar of jelly and a few drinks.Were not recreating the atomic bomb here, Len said. Were trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  It was two people standing there, goofing off, probably having a beer and a glass of wine and saying, What do you think of this?'The first decision they made was that the sandwich should be round.The moon is round, the sun is round, the Earth is round, its our favorite shape, Len said. Do you have to go to a committee and survey people on what the shape should be? No. Its round. So we got that nailed down.Secrets behind the NFLs favorite sandwich Kitchen-counter to mass production Founder Len Kretchmans wife, Emily, suggested commercializing the snack, which got its iconic round shape from initially being cut out using a drinking glass. Innovative technique Putting the jelly in the middle and covering it with the peanut butter turned out to be the key to protecting the jelly from leaking. Whats in a name? The original name of the product, The Incredible Uncrustable, was coined by an 11-year-old boy whose father was involved in the business.Next, he grabbed a cup from his kitchen cabinet.If you asked moms how they (took the crust off a sandwich) 30 years ago, theyd say: I found a glass in my cupboard that was the right dimension and I pressed on the bread and I cut the crust off,' Kretchman said. And thats what we did!They added a crimp to the edges of the crustless bread, which was easy, but then had to figure out how to keep the jelly from oozing, which was not. Every time they thawed their creations, the jelly bled into the bread and ruined the sandwich. Much trial and error followed.We finally put the blob of jelly in the middle of the bread and then covered it with peanut butter and encased the jelly so it doesnt leach into the bread, Kretchman said. That was key. That was our gee-whiz moment.Were not recreating the atomic bomb here... were trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Len Kretchman, Co-inventor of UncrustablesKretchman and his business partner, David Geske, pitched their product to local schools. They needed a name. Once again, the idea landed in their kitchen. They asked the 11-year-old son of a business associate for a suggestion. His answer: The Incredible Uncrustable. Four years later, in 1999, Smuckers bought the company, dropped the first part of the name and introduced the country to the Uncrustable.It took a little time, but the NFL wasnt far behind.The Uncrustables eaten by the NFL in one year would cover over 18 yards of a football fieldThey werent there when former Pro Bowl tight end Dallas Clark was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in 2003. Of that much hes certain. But the moment this new treat joined the food ranks with all that other healthy crap the Colts provided? He cant really say.All that he remembers is the feeling that something beautiful had happened.AdvertisementIts up there with the cell phone where youre like, How is this done?' Clark said. When they came out it was like, Duh, why did someone not think of this a looong time ago?'It was Jon Torines job to stock those snacks, healthy crap and all, for the Colts. And it was an especially important job during the week of the Super Bowl in 2007 when the Colts played the Chicago Bears in Miami. In the hotel ballroom where the team stayed, Torine, the Colts strength and conditioning coach at the time, laid out a spread for players to grab and go as they moved from meeting to meeting.You could throw your playbook on top of em, didnt make any difference. Squished, unsquished, youre gonna crush it. Jeff Saturday, former Colts centerWe were all scoopin and scorin, said Jeff Saturday, a center on that team. We were grabbing five, six at a time.Clark, a player who struggled to keep on weight, would throw them in his backpack, unbothered by what would happen to them once there. The Uncrustables always found their way to the bottom and got smashed by the playbook, he said. But still edible. Still in one compartment.Didnt matter, Saturday said. You could throw your playbook on top of em, didnt make any difference. Squished, unsquished, youre gonna crush it.They are now a staple for many NFL teams. San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle eats two on flights to road games and anywhere from two to four on flights home. Chiefs defensive end Mike Danna eats them at the team facility and at home. Ravens kicker Justin Tucker grabs one from the snack table on his way to meetings. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce claimed on his podcast that he eats more of them than anything else in the world.Were all creatures of habit, dude, Saturday said. Almost freakishly. If youre a two-Uncrustables-a-day kind of guy, thats just what you do.Each week, the NFL consumes nearly the weight of three Travis Kelces in UncrustablesTorine and most nutritionists wouldnt recommend frozen, processed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as their No. 1 healthy snack option for players. But Uncrustables can do the job, especially when time is limited, and even nutritionists at the highest level of sports performance make compromises.AdvertisementThe bread and jelly give players quick carbohydrates. The peanut butter provides a little fat and a little protein. Theyre easy to digest, convenient to eat and a comfort food that players love (though there is wide disagreement as to whether grape or strawberry is the better jelly flavor  the correct answer is strawberry).In fact, the Colts also ate Uncrustables at halftime of Super Bowl XLI, when they beat the Bears 29-17.So maybe that was the difference, Torine said, laughing.",

            "text": "Once Top Advisers to Trump, They Now Call Him Liar, Fascist and Unfit Many of those who served in former President Donald J. Trumps administration  especially his generals, ambassadors and other national security officials  have since turned on Mr. Trump.Former President Donald J. Trump often brags about hiring the best people. But the breadth of the criticism aimed at Mr. Trump, especially from his own former military and national security officials, sets him apart from any modern president.Gen. Mark Milley Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman John Kelly Chief of staff John Bolton National security adviser Nikki Haley U.N. ambassador Rex Tillerson Secretary of state Mike Pompeo Secretary of state Play John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general who served as Mr. Trumps chief of staff, recently called his former boss an authoritarian, saying he admires people who are dictators  he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.Mark Milley, the countrys top military official during the last two years of Mr. Trumps presidency, privately told the journalist Bob Woodward that Mr. Trump is a fascist to the core and said his pursuit of another four years in office makes him the most dangerous person to this country, Mr. Woodward revealed in a recent book.Mr. Trump and those around him rejected the criticism as little more than sour grapes. The former president has called General Milley a loser and worse, and has suggested that the decorated military officer should be executed for treason because of efforts to ease concerns among foreign leaders after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by Mr. Trumps supporters.But the comments from Mr. Kelly and General Milley denigrating Mr. Trumps capacity to serve as commander in chief are particularly striking, even as they echo the sentiments from others across his government and many Republicans outside of his administration.Former generals, admirals, diplomats, intelligence officers and security strategists have publicly or privately accused Mr. Trump of being a liar who lacks basic knowledge about the world and represents a danger to democracy. Members of his cabinet have questioned his loyalty to the country and testified to his chaotic behavior. His press aides have talked about his lack of integrity and his tendency to attack others.And Mike Pence, his own vice president, has accused him of being reckless and putting himself over the Constitution. And Mr. Pence said he walked away from the agenda backed by conservatives. Mr. Pence ran against Mr. Trump and refused to endorse him.Only a few of the former presidents advisers have played an active role in trying to defeat Mr. Trumps bid for another four years in power, often citing their belief that military and national security officials should not meddle in partisan politics. Most have not appeared in ads or sat for recent TV interviews. Just a handful have endorsed Mr. Trumps opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.But they have not disowned their comments about the former president and the danger he poses if he returns to the Oval Office. In recent weeks, Ms. Harris has begun running campaign ads citing the comments from some of the former Trump officials as evidence that he is unfit to serve again.Mr. Trump could regain power soon, and those who advised him the first time have said he is A Threat to Democracy Mr. Trumps national security aides repeatedly described him as a danger to the country and to democracy. Many cited the Jan. 6 violence and his reaction to it as evidence of how he posed a threat to the countrys laws and norms. Others predicted a return to the White House would damage the countrys national security. Surely you cant mean Hitlers generals? And he said, Yeah, yeah, Hitlers generals. John Kelly Chief of staff , said in a recent interview, recalling when Mr. Trump praised the loyalty shown by German generals. Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people  does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. James Mattis Secretary of defense Donald Trump will cause a lot of damage if he is elected in a second term. John Bolton National security adviser The American people deserve to know that President Trump asked me to put him over my oath to the Constitution, but I kept my oath and I always will. Im running for president in part because I think that anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States. Mike Pence Vice presidentIll-Informed and Incurious Several officials have publicly questioned Mr. Trumps intelligence, accusing him of knowing little about history and saying they observed him struggling to understand the complexities of the presidency. Some said he appeared not to be interested in learning about the issues he confronted. Trump lacked basic knowledge of how the government runs, and his impatience with learning about the roles of his senior officials and about alternative models for decision-making limited his ability to lead. When there was conflict, he avoided it or, at times, stoked it. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser His understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of U.S. history was really limited. Its really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesnt even understand the concept for why were talking about this. Rex Tillerson Secretary of state His short attention span (except on matters of personal advantage) renders coherent foreign policy almost unattainable. The United States missed an incalculable number of opportunities in Trumps first term because senior officials necessarily concentrated on keeping a few key policies on track. John Bolton National security adviserDishonest Some members of Mr. Trumps national security team accused him of lying while he was president. Several said he fabricated stories or willingly ignored facts. Others said they witnessed him lying about the results of the 2020 election despite knowing the truth. Trump was caught in a vortex created by the interaction of those narratives with the fragility of his ego and his deep sense of aggrievement. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser Our president must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country. The most important being truth. This president is not able to do that. James Comey F.B.I. director , said after Mr. Trump fired him from his job So many people who had access to his ear who were telling him things, most of which were untrue, and then he began to listen to those voices and form a view that had no basis in fact. Rex Tillerson Secretary of stateMisplaced in His Loyalty Some former aides said Mr. Trump was not loyal to his constituents because he failed to follow a standard conservative agenda. Many questioned his loyalty to the country after witnessing his actions after the election of 2020. Others said he proved disloyal by ignoring rules that govern how sensitive documents are handled. His ego and love of self distorted his perception of the 2020 presidential election. His sense of betrayal drove him to abandon his oath to support and defend the Constitution, a presidents highest obligation. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser He thought I would be loyal and obedient to him. I told him we were loyal to our oath to the Constitution. If he told you to slit someones throat, he thought you would go out and do it. John Kelly White House chief of staff The president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices. Richard Spencer Secretary of the NavyDisorderly and Undisciplined National security advisers and military officials working for Mr. Trump said he created political and diplomatic chaos while in office. Some said they believed he enjoyed causing discord, while others said he pursued policies that triggered strife and disagreement among global allies. Some said he had a temper that added to the sense of chaos. He acts on his instincts. In some respects, that looks like impulsiveness, but its not his intent to act on impulse. I think he really is trying to act on his instincts. Rex Tillerson Secretary of state Hes getting meaner and more offensive by the day. Hes trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. Nikki Haley U.N. ambassador , said while she was running against Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. John Kelly White House chief of staffA Lawbreaker Several of his national security advisers noted that Mr. Trump faces multiple indictments , including federal charges that he sought to overturn the 2020 election. He has denied breaking the law in all of the cases. This is beyond wrong and illegal. Its un-American. The President undermined American democracy baselessly for months. Tom Bossert Homeland security adviser , said after the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6 Ive never seen a defendant beg for it more. By attacking the judge, attacking the jury, attacking the witnesses. James Comey F.B.I. director , said when asked if Mr. Trump would be sentenced to jail time after being convicted of falsifying business records. Todays violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump. James Mattis Secretary of defenseLacking in Integrity One common theme among the former presidents most senior military and national security officials was what some described as a lack of integrity. Several said he was motivated only by self-interest, rather than what was good for the country or the government. Others commented on his ego or used the word unfit to describe him. I think hes unfit for office.  He puts himself before country. His actions are all about him and not about the country. Mark Esper Secretary of defense The facts, however, are clear that he is unfit to be President. If his first four years were bad, a second four will be worse, dismaying many ardent supporters. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty. James Comey F.B.I. directorSimilar warnings about Mr. Trump have come from his other top advisers: almost half of his cabinet, as well as his attorney general, among others. These officials rang the alarm both during and after Mr. Trumps presidency  in books, interviews, essays, speeches and television appearances.People who once worked for Mr. Trump at the highest levels now describe him as unintelligent, chaotic, a danger to American democracy and more. What follows is not an exhaustive list, but rather a representative collection of criticism from Mr. Trumps top advisers.",

[UPBEAT MUSIC] Over the next few days at the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris will accept her partys nomination and reintroduce herself to American voters. Today, my colleague, Astead Herndon, looks at the key periods in Harriss life that explain who she is, what she believes, and the kind of president she might become. Its Monday, August 19. Astead, thank you for coming in here.astead herndonThank you for having me. Im happy to be here.michael barbaroThe strange thing about this election  I mean, there are a lot of strange things about this election.astead herndonIm like, one?michael barbaroOne of the strange things about this election is that we have a Democratic nominee who has been the nominee for, what, four weeks? And did not go through the yearlong public dissection that generally occurs when you run for president and makes everybody very familiar with your life story by the time you become the nominee. And we actually keep hearing that when we go out and report about Harris. A lot of people, theyre interested in her, but they dont really know who she is. And thats why we want to talk to you. We want to tell the story of Kamala Harris in as full a way as possible. And you have spent the past couple of years doing that, not knowing that we would arrive at this moment, but just because it was a story that you got really interested in. How do you think about the life story of Kamala Harris?astead herndonYeah. I think there is often an incentive to try to get an easy answer to who is Kamala Harris or what does she believe in. And the thing that I have learned in covering her over this time is that you should resist that desire, that theres not really an easy answer. And the boxes that folks try to put her in, whether it be about identity or about comparison to past politicians, namely Barack Obama, I dont think are really that helpful in terms of understanding someone whose life and track to this point has been really singular.michael barbaroEmbracing that thesis that this is a singular person whos resistant to easy labels, where do you think we should start to try to understand who she really is? Whats the first chapter of this singular story of Kamala Harris?astead herndonI would start in her growing up. She grows up in Oakland in the backdrop of the 1960s Bay Area, and is really shaped by her family and community thats around her. Her mother was a scientist at the University of California Berkeley, and an immigrant from India who came here to learn at the school and meets her father, who is also an academic there and is a Jamaican immigrant. And importantly, theyre activists who were, like many people in that time, active in the Civil Rights Movement. And she tells stories when shes on the trail about going to marches and rallies from times of being in a stroller. I would also say that the multiculturalness and specifically the racial identity of the place she grows up really matters. This is someone who is growing up really around not only just a Black community, but a very prideful, rich history of Blackness.michael barbaroExplain that.astead herndonThe Black Panthers headquarters was blocks from her house. And her parents did a very intentional effort to place their children in Black affirmation spaces. They would go to these classes on the weekends where kids from the community would come and have these Black history lessons. It was called The Cactus Club. And the reason it was called The Cactus Club is because it was about Black people being able to grow in any environment.michael barbaroJust like a cactus.astead herndonYeah. And that lives alongside her also having a really comfortable relationship with the Indian side of her family. I mean, she would travel to India. Her parents family were folks who were fighting for democracy and their independence movements. She would have those conversations with her grandfather. I mean, so it wasnt someone who I think was really only defined by one thing. But it was very much taught from an early age that you exist, Im using a coconut reference, but you exist in the context of both of those things. And so that was very much an intentional effort from her mother. And by the time shes in elementary school, she finds herself as a part of a group of students who are involved in a desegregation program that buses them to a different part of town. Theyre actually the second class of Black Berkeley to be shipped.michael barbaroBig deal.astead herndonYeah. And its something that really shapes her growing up. I talked to one of her friends from growing up. Her name is Cynthia Bagby, who mentioned remembering when her and Kamala Harris, first grade, were at the bus stop being ready to be bused to a different part of town. And Cynthia told me this story about how nervous she was, about how she didnt have white friends and she knew that they were being put in a different situation and environment.michael barbaroTheyre plunged in a completely alien place.astead herndonAbsolutely. But what Cynthia told me was that she remembers a young Kamala Harris being so confident and being so unfazed by this situation that when they got back from school, she noticed how Kamala had already 10 friends, was kind of socially running the place. Everyone loved her after the first day.michael barbaroThe mayor of the new largely white school.astead herndonYeah. And so those were the type of stories that people would tell that not only was there a confidence that flowed, but there was a comfort with herself and her identity that really attracted people to her.michael barbaroAnd that comfort youre describing seems like it would flow pretty directly from the way her parents raised her, the classes they brought her to, and that this is an extremely self-possessed person who knows her spot in the world.astead herndonAbsolutely. I remember asking her once, where did this come from, youre self-belief? And I remember her saying, I was raised to believe that I belong in every room that I am in. And that is the core of Kamala Harriss self-belief. It does not come from the position she has now. It does not come from status gained later in life. It comes from an instilling of confidence and pride that started from the day she was born. And so by the time that Kamala Harris is in high school, she knows that she wants to go to an HBCU to follow in the footsteps not only of people around her, but of historical figures who she admired, like the Thurgood Marshalls of the world. And I think thats an important choice.michael barbaroWhy?astead herndonBecause youre achieving young people of color, theres sometimes an incentive to follow the White institutional elites to X place, go to an Ivy League, go to this or that. A 15-16-year-old with the world in front of them saying, I want to put myself at Howard University isnt a small choice. It is a recognition of who the communities are that matter to them and their belief that Black folks can shape them to be excellent, period.michael barbaroHow does the next chapter of her life, her chosen career as a prosecutor, how does that flow from everything that youre just describing? All this pride in being a member of the Black community. Because in my, perhaps, naive mind, being in law enforcement in the period when shes coming out of Howard, seems like it might be in conflict with being a proud member of a Black community that American law enforcement is increasingly seen as having a very adversarial relationship with.astead herndonYeah, I think this comes up all the time. And to be clear, it came up when she was growing up. I mean, when I talk to people from Oakland, they say that when young Kamala Harris, theyre shining community star, decided to become a prosecutor, it was a topic of conversation among her family and friends. Like, what you doing, sis?michael barbaroAnd what was her answer?astead herndonShes talked about this a lot in speeches and interviews, and taken people through how she thinks about this decision.archived recording (kamala harris) When it came time to make my career choice, my family gathered around. And they said, Kamala, what are you going to do in your fight for justice? And I got all excited. And I said, Ive decided Im going to be a prosecutor. If you have any sense of who my family is, you will know that at best they found it a curious decision. And with some of them, I had to defend the decision like one would a thesis.astead herndonShe knew she was making a controversial choice.archived recording (kamala harris) I believe safety is a civil right. A civil right to which all people are entitled. And lets talk about a myth, a myth that Black people dont want public safety. That is simply not true.astead herndonAnd part of the reason she gives is that minority communities and specifically Black people deserve safety.archived recording (kamala harris) And I said, why is it that we should only be on the outside of systems? Isnt there a role also for us to play on being on the inside, where the decisions are being made?astead herndonAnd to go back to context, I think its important to recognize this is the 1980s. This is a generation of Black people that are coming after the Civil Rights Movement that have access to institutions and halls of power for the first time. And for a lot of those people, there was a real ethos of, you need to do something with that. You need to wield these instruments of power to be more responsive to Black communities. You could enter those halls and make them things that worked for Black people.michael barbaroWhat does it look like once she gets inside these halls of power, actually becomes a prosecutor? How does she put this philosophy about representation and change into practice?astead herndonShe runs for district attorney in San Francisco. And she, frankly, makes her whole public pitch around this idea that its not empathetic to say, dont lock anybody up. And so thats how she wins that first race. But she also does it, I think, through representing a vision of the future rather than past. Her identity is laced into that argument. The fact that shes young, the fact that shes a person of color, the fact that she is a woman are all things that really matter. It is not about the identity, but that has always been an implicit part of the pitch. She was making an argument that was about the policy.michael barbaroNot about her identity, but her identity obviously came with the package of her as a candidate.astead herndonYes, comes with the package of the candidate and is part of the reason that shes arguing that these institutions can do something different is because I represent something different. And once she wins office, what it looks like for her to put this into practice is a set of policies that I think really add up to the earliest versions of what we now call a Progressive prosecutor. She says that you can be focused on delivering safety and accountability while you also look at root causes or try to be empathetic to people, in a way that separates herself from what, I would describe, as the crime bill, Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, 1990s view of the world.michael barbaroWhats a good example of this?astead herndonOne example I would say is the Back On Track Program that she started. That was one of the first to allow formerly incarcerated felons to find their way back into the workforce. Shes really proud of that. Thats obviously been something thats been taken nationally at this point. I think its just the thing that people agree on should happen.michael barbaroThat there needs to be a bridge between prison and the rest of your life.astead herndonBut that, at the time, was kind of spicy. And thats one of the things that she piloted. The other thing I would say and the thing that blew up is what she was doing around the idea of truancy or the chronic absence of children in schools. One of the things that happened in the time when she was prosecutor was there were some data that came out that showed that people who are incarcerated usually missed a bunch of school in their time of growing up, that early absences in childhood were indicative of someone who might have future criminal justice problems. And so there was a question of what to do about that.archived recording 1 Joining us to explain how truancy impacts the entire family is San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris. It is great to have you with us.astead herndonAnd from a prosecutors vantage point, she actually tried to take this problem on.archived recording (kamala harris) And what weve done is we started an initiative a couple of years ago that involved me assigning prosecutors to go and meet with the teacher when they met with the parent. And so the prosecutors there and the parent says, whos that mean looking person? And they say, thats the prosecutor, because if we cant fix this problem, they may end up prosecuting you. But by the way, the way we want to fix the problem is weve got all these services for you.astead herndonShe used her role to Institute a series of policies that would hold the parents accountable for chronically absent children.archived recording (kamala harris) And its been fantastic, because when the principal would otherwise call the parent and say, Miss Smith, Johnnys not in class. Would you return my call? Call went unanswered. Now, the principal calls and says, Miss Smith, Johnnys not in class. And by the way, that DA Kamala Harris has said she might prosecute you and send you to jail. And that call gets returned.astead herndonBasically, after a series of warnings, charging the parents if their kids miss enough school under the idea of it would make the kids come more frequently and stop them from getting involved in the criminal justice system kind of before it becomes a big problem. And while that could be good in theory, the reality was that this resulted in a targeting of Black, low income, people of color.michael barbaroThe very people that she thinks of herself as trying to improve the lives of.astead herndonAbsolutely. There were a couple of instances, particularly when the program was adopted by other places, that resulted in parents being perp walked, that resulted in charging certain parents. And I think it had the stench of punitive meanness that was already coming down on people who had a lot of problems.michael barbaroWhat do you make of that?astead herndonTo me, its indicative of a worldview that is reflective of a prosecutor. I think if youre a mayor, a city councilor, Senate, or House, youre used to seeing problems from a 360 lens and you get afforded the space to come up with a vision to solve them. Thats not really what prosecutors do.michael barbaroThey charge or they dont.astead herndonThey react. They hold people accountable. Its about law enforcement. And so this example of truancy is one of the times she tries to take that law enforcement view of the world and apply it to root causes of a problem. And so I think you can see it from a lot of different vantage points. And one way, its a Progressive prosecutor thinking about how can I attack a problem at its root. Thats a really kind of progressive thought. But at the same time, what she did with that was kind of punitive. It was not something that really attacked the full scope and then I think had the impact of, frankly, reinforcing some of the same tropes about these parents and these communities that Im pretty sure she wants to avoid. And I think that shows the limits of that kind of accountability viewpoint.michael barbaroOr perhaps even the contradictions of it. But she seems comfortable with those contradictions. That on some level, yes, shes trying to solve a problem at its root, insofar as shes able to do it. And it might actually result in some parents getting in some real trouble, parents in the Black community shes there to try to protect and improve the lives of, but shes kind of made peace with that.astead herndonI think so to a certain extent. For one, on truancy, she does back off. And so I do think that there were academics and Progressives who reached out to that office to say that you are making a mistake. And some of that eventually landed. But I do think that there is a sense of comfort with the idea that harm creates consequences. And some people are going to get locked up.michael barbaroAnd you might not like me for it.astead herndonAnd you might not like me for it, but I think you like the results of it. And I think her view of the world is accountability can be empathetic. And she rides this approach to the attorney generals office and then eventually to the US Senate. And shes comfortable with that approach. Its when she goes to Washington and eventually runs for president when a lot of this becomes uncomfortable.michael barbaroWell be right back. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Astead, take us into the next chapter of this story here. Kamala Harris as a Democratic candidate for president, when this record of hers as a prosecutor, as you just said, becomes less comfortable for her.astead herndonYeah, I think about the 2016 election. On that night, she was all but guaranteed to be the next senator from California.michael barbaroShe wins the US Senate seat the night of the Clinton versus Trump election?astead herndonYes. And there was a sense among Democrats that not only would Hillary Clinton win, but Clinton would be a transition to a next coming of Democratic stars.michael barbaroBut a few years down the road.astead herndonA few years down the road.michael barbaroBut, of course, thats not how that night goes. Donald Trump wins. And very immediately, Democrats are thrust into this mass resistance where they are searching for someone who can become the face of leading the party out of the rubble. And so she goes from being someone who should have six years to start to understand Washington, to someone who is being floated as a possible 2020 presidential candidate. Its a real sea change in the trajectory that she was supposed to have. And as shes having this open discussion about whats happening next, she has a couple viral moments that make her a celebrity. The Supreme Court confirmation hearings.archived recording (kamala harris) Can you think of any laws give government the power to make decisions about the male body? archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Uh.astead herndonI think Kavanaugh really encapsulated a lot of that.archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Im happy to answer a more specific question. archived recording (kamala harris) Male versus female. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) There are medical procedures.astead herndonThe way she was going at Jeff Sessions and Trump figures of the time.archived recording (kamala harris) Sir, I have just a few  archived recording (jeff sessions) Will you let me qualify it? If I dont qualify it, youll accuse me of lying. I need to be correct as best I can. archived recording (kamala harris) I do want you to be honest. archived recording (jeff sessions) Im not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous.astead herndonAnd she becomes a hero for a lot of these folks and a driver of Democratic fundraising. And so it elevates you from someone who people are talking about in the background to being someone who is seen as a star of the party. And that only furthers the question of running for president. And frankly, I think cements it. And so by the time that she is actually putting her hat in the ring, the campaign comes up with a strategy that I think is reflective of the things we were talking about before. They dont want to choose an ideological lane. They want her to be everything to everyone. And they think that they can do that in this race.michael barbaroAnd be true to herself.astead herndonAnd be true to herself.archived recording (kamala harris) Whats up, Oakland? [LAUGHS]astead herndonAnd I remember the announcement speech she gave in Oakland where there was 20,000 people outside.archived recording (kamala harris) It was just a couple of blocks from this very spot, nearly 30 years ago as a young district attorney, I walked into the courtroom for the first time and said the five words that would guide my lifes work, Kamala Harris for the people.astead herndonAnd she told a very clear story about why she became a prosecutor, about what her vision was going forward.archived recording (kamala harris) I knew our criminal justice system was deeply flawed. But I also knew the profound impact law enforcement has on peoples lives and its responsibility to give them safety and dignity. I knew I wanted to protect people. And I knew that the people in our society who are most often targeted by predators are also most often the voiceless and vulnerable. And on that point, I believed then, as I do now, no one should be left to fight alone. [CHEERING]astead herndonAnd I think was really reflective of the vision of what that campaign thought they could do.michael barbaroAnd the story youve been telling here.astead herndonAnd the story weve been telling here. The problem was thats not how that primary went. It wasnt a primary that was really about working with institutions to make marginal gains.michael barbaroIt was about blowing them up to a degree.astead herndonYeah. And over the next several months archived recording 2 Good evening, Senator. Thank you for being here. You position yourself as aligned with the Progressive movement to make criminal justice less punitive and racist. Yet, your record as a prosecutor shows that you embrace the tough-on-crime mentality.astead herndonAs activists are creating litmus tests about what progressive means, about what constitutes criminal justice reform archived recording 3 Will you support the Bernie Sanders bill, which essentially gets rid of insurance? archived recording (kamala harris) I support Medicare for all, but I really do need to clear up what happened on that stage. It was in the context of saying, lets get rid of all the bureaucracy. Lets get all of the ways  archived recording 3 Not the insurance companies? archived recording (kamala harris) No. Thats not what I meant. I know it was astead herndon forcing her to answer more specific questions about what health care systems should look like and things like that.michael barbaroThis is the year where the moderators are always asking the Democratic candidates on the debate stage to raise their hand if they think that private health insurance should go away.astead herndonYeah.archived recording 4 Youve been asked to clarify this question a couple of times over the course of the campaign. Once and for all, do you believe private insurance should be eliminated in this country? archived recording (kamala harris) No. archived recording 4 You dont? archived recording (kamala harris) No, I do not. archived recording 4 But you raised your hand last night. archived recording (kamala harris) The question was, would you give up your private insurance for that option? And I said, yes. archived recording 4 I think you heard it differently than others then. archived recording (kamala harris) Probably, because thats what I heard.astead herndonAnd the primary became more and more about structural change and about how you articulate policy visions. She fell further and further behind, partly because thats not how she functions. And so at the time and when she was supposed to introduce herself to the country, I think the campaign was telling a fairly inconsistent story about who she was personally and who she was ideologically, and people werent really responding to that. And that feeling ends up overtaking the campaign.archived recording 5 We are confirming that Senator Kamala Harris plans to drop out of the 2020 presidential race. archived recording 6 Miss Harris entered the race as a major force on the campaign trail. You recall she had a huge crowd in Oakland. But she failed to capitalize on that early enthusiasm and plummeted in the polls. [UPBEAT MUSIC]michael barbaroThat race and the way youre describing it, Astead, makes me want to understand what happened to that self-confident person who doesnt want to check the boxes and knows who she is, and says, accept me on my own terms. Obviously, one of the answers are the debate stages and the litmus tests you just mentioned. But we all know what happened in that race. The person who won the Democratic primary astead herndonWas the person who flipped all those tests off.michael barbaroAnd the person who sounded the most like Kamala Harris, Joe Biden. Equally associated with moderate politics, law and order, defending the police, and working within the system. She could have done what he did.astead herndonAbsolutely. It wasnt as if those positions were incompatible with the Democratic electorate. But what Joe Biden was willing to do in that primary that Kamala Harris wasnt was tell those Progressive groups to  they flipped them off. He told them, I dont care what your litmus tests are. This is who I am. Youre going to take this experience. And most importantly, Joe Biden was telling a consistent story about electability. I can beat Trump, and thats what you need to focus on. That was not where other people were. And most importantly, Harris was pulled away from what I think that self-confidence was.michael barbaroIt goes back to this idea perhaps that this just happened too fast. She wasnt ready.astead herndonI think so. When youre a journalist asking Bernie, Biden, even Warren, a question, theyve spent so much time thinking about running for president and their worldview, they return to a core belief. They return back to a basic, fundamental understanding they have about why problems are the way that they are. And no matter what question you ask, even if they dont fully know, theyre going to return back to that core. What was missing from Harris, in my opinion of 2020, was that sense of core. And so when she was asked questions on arenas she was uncomfortable in, you could feel her swimming for an answer. And I think that read as inauthentic. And particularly when youre not a figure that people already know. And so in her moment of introducing herself to the country, she was the most distant from the person shes always been. And I think that gap is what doomed that campaign.michael barbaroAnd then, of course, out of the ashes of this pretty abject failure of a campaign comes the vice presidency.astead herndonYeah. And I think its important to remember how she drops out in a way that I think was really sudden for people. And almost immediately, you saw the tide of sympathy turn in the Democratic Party.michael barbaroToward her?astead herndonToward her.michael barbaroFascinating.astead herndonPeople saying, maybe we were too hard on her. And that started immediately. And so by the time Joe Biden becomes someone whos looking for a VP and then, importantly, makes a pledge to choose a woman in that summer, a lot changes between the time that Biden becomes the nominee and the time in which hes selecting a VP. You have not only the onset of the pandemic and the shutdown of the country, but you also have the explosion of the racial justice protests that happened after George Floyds murder. And so the conversation around Bidens VP selection gets wrapped up in both of those facts. And you have a pretty open debate among the party about whether he has to choose a Black woman.michael barbaroNow theres pressure not just to choose a woman, but to choose a Black woman.astead herndonAnd so I think there was a feeling that if you did not choose Kamala Harris, you were skipping over the most qualified Black woman. And so the campaign chooses Harris. And I think its important to remember it was their best fundraising day that they had all year when they chose Harris.michael barbaroBut the result of this, and I want you to correct me if Im in any way wrong about this, is that shes being put in something of an identity box. And she doesnt like identity boxes.astead herndonIts true. And I think that she does not like being identity first as the reason shes in the room, even if thats part of her worldview. It is a very understandable feeling to say, I dont want to be here only because Im a Black-South Asian woman, period. And it created a situation where the DEI hire framing that, obviously, Republicans have latched on to, was always in the air with her selection. And I think, frankly, it reflects the thinking of the Biden inner circle at the time, the underestimation they had of both her and I think their misconceptions about the political moment at large.michael barbaroExplain that.astead herndonI think its most clear in the policy portfolios she takes on. She was assigned what, I think, is universally seen as a horrible electoral platform, which is the root causes of migration in certain Central American countries.michael barbaroRight. Its like asking someone to solve the greatest riddle in the last 50 years of American foreign policy.astead herndonTotally.michael barbaroAnd Harris knew this was an electoral loser. She actually asked out of the assignment. [LAUGHS]: Can I have something else, please?astead herndonYeah. And Biden made clear, no, this is what I want you to do. And it has immediate impacts.archived recording (kamala harris) I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border astead herndonThink about the infamous press conference she had with the president of Guatemala talking about immigrants.michael barbaroYep.archived recording (kamala harris)  do not come. Do not come.astead herndonThe interview she had with Lester Holt about whether she went to the border or not. There was an understanding that this was a political loser, but it was something that they tasked her with and that she, frankly, just had to soldier on from. The other thing that happens, and I think this is natural with VP office versus West Wing, was there was a push and pull about which events to use her at, particularly in the first couple of years. And to the point about not being want to be put in a box of race and gender, there was a story I heard about a time in which the West Wing wanted her to be used at this event where there was a baby formula shortage that was national news.michael barbaroTotally.astead herndonAnd the administration was doing some efforts to try to make sure they could get more formula. And there was a plane landing that was filled with formula. And the administration wanted to do a photo op taking credit for solving baby formula crisis. Classic political maneuver. And they asked Harris to go. And, again, to the point about when is identity helpful versus when does it put you in a box? This is something she didnt want to do.michael barbaroBe kind of womaned.astead herndonYeah, be put in that box. And I think it reflects the hard choices that sometimes identity can put you in. And so particularly in those first couple of years, that was a push and pull between her and White House. But she largely takes on the assignments that the White House gives her. And most importantly, she maintains an intense sense of loyalty to President Biden that he really appreciates. And so it matters to him that she says, yes, when he reassigns her that immigration assignment, and that she goes to Guatemala, and she does those things right.michael barbaroShe does almost all the things.astead herndonShe does the things that are required of her. The impact is that for the first couple of years of her as VP, shes still dealing with some of the clouds that hung over her during the presidential race. There is a sense that you dont really know what shes doing or what she believes in. But I think that really starts to change around 2022.archived recording (kamala harris) This is the first time in the history of our nation that a constitutional right has been taken from the people of America.astead herndonAfter the Dobbs decision, it creates a lane for her in the administration that she really latches on to.archived recording (kamala harris) I do know that the American people fight for freedom and believe in the womans right to make decisions about her own body.astead herndonAnd she becomes the spokesperson for the administration on the issue and becomes the liaison between abortion rights groups and the White House.archived recording (kamala harris) What has happened here in Arizona is a new inflection point. It has demonstrated once and for all that overturning Roe was just the opening act, just the opening act of a larger strategy to take womens rights and freedoms.astead herndonShe starts embracing the language of freedoms and Democrats protecting reproductive rights.archived recording (kamala harris) And now, because of Donald Trump, more than 20 states in our nation have bans. Now, because of Donald Trump, one in three women of reproductive age in our country live in a state that has a Trump abortion ban.astead herndonThe stump speech was better. It just clarified her pitch because she can go back to something that a lot of people really care about and, most importantly, is at the top of Democrats list. And so I think the first couple of years are education in Washington that may not have happened before she was running for president. But what happened after that was she traveled across the country and, I think, took on a lot of the campaigning efforts that Biden was not doing. And so as a result, she became someone who was more comfortable doing those interactions in a place she wasnt in 2019.michael barbaroAnd perhaps this is why shes ready for what ends up being this extraordinary moment that she encounters a couple of weeks ago.astead herndonYeah, and I think a lot of people were surprised at the speed at which the party unified around her. But it is explained a little more by the work shes done over the last couple of years. When she was going to events as VP, she was calling DNC members and creating those relationships. She was checking in with donors. She was growing a backroom reputation of someone who could lead the party, if necessary. And so when Biden drops and endorses her, she leaned on all of those things to really coalesce support very quickly. And I think there was a greater willingness to see her as someone who could step up to the top of the ticket, because of the advocacy she was doing on issues like abortion over the last couple of years. And so she laid the foundation to really seize that opportunity once it arrived.michael barbaroAnd yet, thats the story of party insiders rallying around her, perhaps a step because of what she did over the past two years as vice president. But it still feels true that the American public doesnt really know what she stands for and exactly who she is. And at this point, its unclear whether thats going to matter in a race where there was so much unhappiness about Biden and Trump. But thats an unusual thing, as we said at the beginning of this conversation.astead herndonYeah. I mean, a lot of the work we are talking about, to your point, is insider political stuff. For most people, I think she was running for president, she became vice president, kind of went away, and now shes the nominee. And so I think that is the reason why Republicans are trying to paint her as flimsy and nonsubstantive. And although at this moment, shes been able to step away from 2019 and say, that wasnt the real version of me, I do think it leads to the question, what is then? And I think over the next three months, the onus is on the campaign to tell that story. And I think that starts at the DNC.michael barbaroLets talk about that story for just a second, because there is a clear story to tell of a young girl who grows up in Black Oakland, child of activists, becomes a prosecutor in the name of bringing that identity and pride inside an institution that she thinks needs to change with her at the center of that change, and the application of that approach of hers to criminal justice, an approach that, like Harris herself, defies being easily put into boxes. Its the story of somebody who believes you can be multiple things at the same time. You can be an empathetic Progressive, but also believe in punishment and in accountability. But my question is, is that a story which we know she didnt want to tell in 2019-2020, that she wants to tell now? The story that you have been telling us here.astead herndonYes.michael barbaroIs that going to be at the center of her campaign?astead herndonYes. I think that the biggest change from 2019 to now is a comfort with that story and a political moment thats more ready to receive it. And so already she has said the words prosecutor maybe more than she said in four years ago. And with Donald Trump on the other side, a convicted felon with looming charges, accountability is on the comeback. And she was going to own that type of framing.michael barbaroA story very faithful to who Kamala Harris was that was hard to sell last time she ran and that she kind of ran away from, now feels like the story she should be embracing and that the country might very much embrace.astead herndonYeah. I think she will return to that articulation. And so the moment of unity were seeing now was always under the surface possible. And I think a lot of that is because she is a vessel that you can see what you want to see in. If you want to see a Progressive, theres enough there you probably can. If you want to see a moderate, you probably can see that too. And so what I think is one of the stories here is a ideological fluidity that was once seen as a problem is now being seen as a solution.michael barbaroAstead, were talking about Kamala Harris here as a candidate in a race thats going to be over in a few months. And youre suggesting that her ideological fluidity might benefit her in a race like this. If she wins, though, the question is going to become, what does that fluidity mean for her as actual president in the hot seat? And what kind of philosophy is this former prosecutor who, as youve laid it out, has always been most comfortable thinking still in the mind of a law and order person? Whats that going to look like when shes commander in chief and leader of the free world?astead herndonAbsolutely. We dont know. But come governing time, all of this fluidity will be put to the test. And we dont know what type of president she would be. I mean, we dont know what the agenda of a Kamala Harris Democratic Party would look like and how that would differ from the one that Biden has laid out. But frankly, if you ask any Democrat, they would say thats tomorrows problem. And as long as she wins the election and stops Donald Trump from winning another term, they dont care. They really dont care.[laughs]Theyll deal with that then.michael barbaroRight. Thats the thing about a tomorrow problem, you deal with it tomorrow.astead herndonYeah. Yeah. Who cares?michael barbaroAstead thank you very much. Really appreciate it.astead herndonThank you for having me. [UPBEAT MUSIC]michael barbaro",

            "text": "Sue Altman speaking with voters after a candidate forum held by Jewish organizations in New Jersey. A Democrat, she is running against Representative Thomas Kean Jr., a first-term Republican.Sue Altman has made a name for herself by taking on political heavy hitters in New Jersey.First was Chris Christie, the famously pugnacious Republican governor, who, during a 2016 town hall, was so exasperated by her questions about education funding that he tossed his microphone to her.Three years later, she tangled with George Norcross III, then among the states most influential Democratic power brokers, as she led a drumbeat of criticism against corporate tax breaks awarded to companies with close ties to him.Now Ms. Altman is seeking to unseat Thomas Kean Jr., a first-term Republican congressman who is the scion and namesake of a former governor, in one of a handful of races nationwide that will determine whether Republicans retain control of the House.The result of Tuesdays election in New Jerseys Seventh Congressional District may say a lot about how Mr. Kean, 56, has campaigned in the race, where recent polls have prompted Democrats to mount a last-minute push in hopes of flipping the seat.Image Mr. Kean, a son of a former Republican governor, was elected to the House two years ago. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York TimesBut it also may offer insight into the direction of New Jersey and of suburban swing districts like the Seventh, an affluent and well-educated region split nearly evenly between Republicans and Democrats. President Biden beat Donald J. Trump there by four points in 2020, but two years later Mr. Kean beat the Democratic incumbent, Tom Malinowski, by about three points.Ben Dworkin, director of Rowan Universitys Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship, said he saw the election mainly as a referendum on the hold that Mr. Trump has on the moderate wing of the Republican Party.If Democrats are able to win in NJ-7, Professor Dworkin said, then it will really show the negative impact that Donald Trump had on Republican candidates down ballot.Republican PACs have poured millions of dollars into the race. Voters in some parts of the North Jersey district, which stretches from the states border with Pennsylvania through quaint towns filled with horse farms to the eastern cities of Rahway and Linden, say their mailboxes fill regularly with Kean campaign literature.According to polls, Mr. Kean is ahead by about two points against Ms. Altman, a former teacher and professional basketball player who until last year ran the Working Families alliance, a left-leaning political organizing group.The campaign arm of House Democrats committed to spending about $4 million just last week  its first financial commitment in the race  after surveys showed that the contest was narrowing. Democratic Party luminaries like Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a leader of the congressional progressive PAC, and Bill Bradley, a former U.S. senator and New York Knicks star, have joined Ms. Altman, 42, on the campaign trail.At a candidate forum last week, the races high stakes and the potency of abortion rights as a political issue were on display.Mr. Kean described Ms. Altmans support for abortion access as abortion on demand, the same terminology he used two years ago in his successful campaign against Mr. Malinowski.Ms. Altman supports abortion access and a New Jersey law that codified the right to the procedure throughout a pregnancy.Mr. Kean, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, describes himself as pro-choice and said he would oppose a national ban on abortion. But he has also said that abortion policy was best handled at the state level when asked about the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which ended a constitutional right to abortion.During the forum, Mr. Kean, who opposed funding for Planned Parenthood while in the State Legislature, twice referred to doctors who commit abortion. When asked about the phrasing, which could be interpreted as condemning doctors who perform abortions, he said he had misspoken.Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by 917,000 voters.But that is not the case in the Seventh Congressional District, where the G.O.P. has more support and people who are not registered with either major party represent the largest bloc of voters. The district is filled with fiscally conservative residents who also support moderate social policies and who helped to propel Republicans like Mr. Christie; Mr. Keans father, Gov. Thomas Kean Sr.; and Christine Todd Whitman to the states highest office.A Monmouth University poll that put Mr. Kean ahead by two percentage points also found that more voters trusted him to handle issues related to the economy and crime. That edge was dwarfed, however, by Ms. Altmans advantage when voters were asked about abortion and reproductive health policy.Mr. Kean and his campaign have emphasized the brand of liberal politics that Ms. Altman stood for while leading Working Families, one of the states most progressive organizations. He has also highlighted a comment she made in 2020 on social media that referred to those of us working on #DefundThePolice in Jersey.She has apologized for that sentiment and disavowed it, saying she has since gained a better understanding of policing from officers and family members who worked for police agencies.But it is an issue that has resonated. At a town-hall meeting Ms. Altman held in Phillipsburg, on the states western flank, a member of the audience, Vinny Panico, challenged her position on policing.We have people breaking into houses, rummaging through peoples personal belongings to find their car keys to steal their cars, Mr. Panico, 33, a Republican, said in a subsequent interview, referring to a yearslong uptick in car thefts. Our police departments, and our men and women in blue, and our justice system, need support.Like Mr. Kean, Ms. Altman has worked to appeal to centrist voters, or, as she describes them, moderate people who are witnessing their beloved Republican Party dwindling down to this extremist morass.She grew up in the district, regularly mentions that her parents are Republicans, and in stump speeches stresses her background as an anti-corruption advocate with a record of opposing Democratic as well as Republican leaders.Both candidates are highly educated and each has raised more than $5 million in campaign contributions. Ms. Altman has two masters degrees from Oxford; Mr. Kean has a masters from Tufts and completed his doctoral studies there.But the comparisons end there.Mr. Kean is an awkward public speaker, holds few events open broadly to the public and avoids most media requests for interviews.Ms. Altmans energy and candor are among the first things people note after listening to her speak.To me, shes like a breath of fresh air, Melissa Lipman, 78, a Democrat, said after an event last week.",

            "text": "What does it really mean to live in a country where abortion is no longer a constitutional right? Since 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, many states have made it all but impossible to get abortion care within their borders, and have done their best to isolate people facing unwanted or complicated pregnancies, making them afraid to reach out to medical providers or even to friends and loved ones who might help them. New laws have forced doctors to delay care in life-threatening situations and made women afraid to seek it, leading to preventable deaths. Did anyone really want this?Even when the consequences havent been that dire, the day-to-day reality of abortion in Americas left-behind places now involves navigating constant undercurrents of confusion and fear: Is this pill I found on the internet safe? If I miscarry, is anyone going to help me? Or, in the cases of some doctors: How can I help this patient without getting arrested?We asked people at the front lines of abortion access to help us understand how the new laws have filtered into their worlds. They answered our call with texts, audio messages, videos and pictures; some shared their stories anonymously out of fear of reprisal. Taken as a whole, their dispatches show us an untenable status quo, held together by sheer grit and determination. But for how much longer?This presidential election will be the first since the Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, when voters will be presented with a choice: to try to rein in the chaos unleashed by the ruling or to live in a country that continues to be shaped by it.",

            "text": "As the votes were counted on election night 2016, the first big sign of trouble for Hillary Clinton came from Michigan, arguably the most Democratic of the presidential swing states. In 2020, Joe Biden flipped it back to the Democrats. Now, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump appear to be in a dead heat in Michigan, and its once again crucial for winning the presidency. For our latest Times Opinion focus group, we gathered a cross-section of Michigan voters to assess the race in the home stretch.The takeaway isnt especially positive for Ms. Harris.Our five independents, four Democrats and two Republicans were clear on a few points: Most want significant change in America under the next president, and the bulk of them cite the economy as their top issue and care more about the candidates policies than their values. One voter was troubled by Ms. Harriss support for arms to Israel and is leaning toward Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Others thought Mr. Trump didnt understand what it meant to struggle financially.Perhaps most worrisome for Ms. Harris, nine of our 11 participants thought she would pursue policies similar to Mr. Bidens. Muhammad, a 25-year-old software engineer and registered independent who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020, said he was struck by a recent TV ad showing Ms. Harris on The View saying she could not think of a thing she would have done differently from Mr. Biden during their administration. For him and others, Harris's problems boil down to two words: \"Change\" and \"Biden.\"I understand not pushing Biden under the bus, but she needs to be more authentic and actually take responsibility for the failures of her administration. She was the border czar, and that is a failure. All she needed to do was be authentic about that, Muhammad said.Some participants were enthusiastic about Ms. Harriss energy and ideas and thought that as a woman, she represented change. But as for who will win Michigan and the presidency, these voters thought the race was trending toward Trump, even though several of them saw him as dangerous and unhinged.",

These sweet, crunchy, no-bake snack bars get their name from the way amaranth seeds \"jump for joy\" as they pop in a hot pan, and also from the traditional harvesting method of jumping and dancing on plants to release seeds. Originating in the barrios of Xochimilco, a Mexico City borough famous for its ancient floating gardens, alegras showcase the versatility of amaranth, a drought-resistant plant cultivated for thousands of years. In this recipe, honey, dried cherries and cinnamon combine with anise seeds to give a distinctive licorice flavor that adds depth to the sweetness. Pop your own amaranth if you dont mind a few kernels jumping for joy out of your pan, or use store-bought puffed amaranth for a quick and easy lunchbox or deskside treat.",

One doughnut-shop secret to the perfect apple fritter: use a lot of cinnamon. It is going to seem like a mistake, but fried doughnuts (see Tip) require a lot more apple, cinnamon and salt for the flavor to punch through than if they were baked. The second trick, which achieves that crispy but melt in your mouth texture: chop the dough. It might seem a bit fussy but they dont have to be exact cuts, you just need -inch pieces.

Working with one ball at a time on a clean work surface, use a rolling pin or ghee-greased palms to flatten each ball into a 4-inch disk. Put 1 tablespoon of the pea mixture in the center and pull all the edges of the dough up and around it into a ball, being careful not to let the outermost edges get wet with filling. Twist and pull the edges together to close them, pinching off all the excess dough at the same time. (Try not to rip the dough, or oil will get inside the kachori when you fry it.

She spent a lot of time in pubs on early '90s London business trips, and the only vegetarian dish was very often a baked potato. This is where she discovered the ingenuity of filling a soft, steamy potato with all kinds of tasty toppings that absorb nicely into the starchy flesh. In this recipe, she subs out the big potato for smaller, thin-skinned ones (for a prettier presentation), and the bacon bits, chives and packaged cheese for spicier, brighter toppings: chiles, chaat masala, onions and ginger. This dish takes almost no time to put together once the potatoes are baked, but looks very impressive as an appetizer or a small side. Tip: Cut the ginger, onion and chiles while the potatoes bake, so everything is ready for assembly. Priya Krishna",

The action of mashing and stirring a fresh pot of rice until the loose grains hold one shape feels almost as if youre kneading bread, though, Mr. Thiam says, a more accurate parallel would be the act of making fufu, the pounded meal thats central to West African cuisine. Make the rice balls whatever size you like; they make excellent finger food, especially dipped in maaf, the velvety, rich Senegalese peanut stew (often called groundnut stew) that tastes like savoriness incarnate.

Hungarian peppers would be ideal. Typically enjoyed at their yellow stage, they are sweet and savory with a mild heat level. Red bell peppers are more modest, with their predominantly sweet flavor, but make a delicious option for this recipe. The dish, adapted from Pass the Plate by Carolina Gelen (Clarkson Potter, 2024), is vegan as written, but you can use this foundational recipe to make it your own.

            "text": "Grilled cheese is a near-perfect food on its own, but adding bacon, kimchi or, in this case, heaps of caramelized onions really makes it special. Caramelizing onions takes a good half-hour, so save this recipe for when you have a little extra time and company (this recipe serves two). If time permits, you could even prep them ahead in a slow cooker. Rather than layer the grated Gruyre and the warm caramelized onions in the sandwich, you should stir them together before assembling, which guarantees that the cheese will melt evenly throughout and that each bite will contain the perfect ratio of fragrant cheese to jammy onions. A splash of sherry, red-wine or white-wine vinegar added to the onions balances out the buttery flavors, but a side salad dressed with a tangy mustard vinaigrette would do the trick, too. (Watch the video of Ali Slagle making French onion grilled cheese here.)",

Brush each donut one by one on all sides - top and bottom - in the melted butter, and then immediately after drop the donut into the cinnamon sugar bowl on both sides to coat the whole donut, gently tossing as needed. Do this one by one. This way the donuts wont absorb the butter and get soggy. And just dropping cinnamon sugar on top of them is really inefficient. 2) Agree with others that 6 TBSPs of melted butter for coating 12 donuts is way too much. You can easily halve it to 3 TBSPs. 3) Agree with others both to be careful about separating ingredients for batter vs coating and that the batter could have more spice! I accidentally put the full 2 TSPs cinnamon in the batter but the donuts smelled and tasted delicious so Id probably do it again on purpose.Is this helpful?",

This produces a relatively large cookie that is both chewy and cake-like on the inside and crispy outside. As others note, there is a fair amount of spread as they bake. I put 8 cookies each on parchment lined, full sized baking sheet and yielded 20 cookies. 1T/scoop would work well for bite-sized cookies. They are quite sweet.

This recipe calls for dropping the egg into the hot soup and leaving it, which will give you chunks. A tip: If you have a liquid measuring cup with a spout, beat the egg in that, as it will give you more control when pouring the egg into the hot liquid.

            "text": "How Does a Pressure Cooker Work?Dating to the 17th century, the first pressurized cooking pot was developed by the French physicist Denis Papin. Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.A pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers  stovetop and electric  are quite safe. They dont explode as your grandmothers may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.For a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, theyre heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the pots temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isnt hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.With an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cooks having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And dont worry: It wont explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high.",

A simple mix of lemon, garlic and lots of herbs enliven the potatoes and spinach and using ground meat ensures a lot of flavor in very little time. Ground turkey or pork would be just as good, if you prefer. Russets can be substituted for Yukon golds, but their texture will be more grainy and less creamy. Mature spinach or frozen spinach works best here because of its mellow flavor, as opposed to baby spinach, which is more tannic. Add the amount of dill that sounds best to you, or if you dont like it, swap in a few tablespoons of fresh parsley or mint.",

One suggestion- the recipe calls for slicing 1/4 inch off of the TOP of the garlic. Ive always roasted garlic by cutting the BOTTOM of the garlic bulb, but did as instructed this time. Immediately, I realized that this was a mistake, as all of the cloves were no longer attached to each other. I tried to hold it all together while getting the little nuggets into the foil, but it was difficult. When I had to squeeze the garlic out, I had to handle each clove individually. Not ideal. Cut the bottom off the cloves will stay connected, and youll just squeeze the whole bulb into the soup. This was delicious, and Ill be making it again later this week for friends.

Let the mixture come to a boil and use the wet pastry brush to brush down the sides of the saucepan to dissolve any stuck-on sugar crystals. (Dont forget to check the egg white mixture and turn off the mixer whenever necessary.) Clip the candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan (its OK if its coated in honey), reduce the heat to medium and boil the mixture without stirring, occasionally swirling the saucepan, until it registers 310 degrees, then remove from the heat immediately. With the mixer running on medium-high speed, stream the sugar mixture into the bowl just as you did the honey. Once youve added all of the sugar mixture, increase the speed to high and continue to beat until the sides of the bowl are warm but not hot and the mixture is very thick, dense and voluminous, about 4 minutes (the mixer might strain against the mixture).",

I have one tip and one tip only for those who have issues with pork chops tasting bland brine BRINE BRIIIIIIIINE!!! Pork chops like all meat need salt, and its amazing what a simple brine will do for your pork and chicken. We make a simple brine of equal parts (about 1/4 cup) kosher salt and brown sugar and add a few garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and peppercorns. You can play around with any herbs and flavors you want in your brine. Dissolve the salt and sugar, cool it down (for food safety purposes) and stick the chops in to refrigerate for anywhere from 4-12 hours. You could literally just cook them as is at this point, but a brine elevates a recipe like this as well to be amazing and flavorful. Dont skip brining your chops!!!Is this helpful? 1",

Underneath, the blueberries become molten as they bake, and the lemon juice brings out apples tart pleasures. Like any warm crisp, this one is best served with a scoop of ice cream.",

It would be more helpful if, instead of 20 garlic cloves, which is an open ended amount, it was measured by cups or grams or ounces. Also, boiling the pasta in a shallow pan does make it overcooked and creamy, but its also quite dangerous. When youre swirling it around so that it doesnt clump together, some of the water does come out of the pan and burn your foot, which is what happened to me, so I wish that issue was addressed.

            "text": "You awaken in a dirty, empty room. Your foot is chained to a pipe and you have nothing apart from a hacksaw.Two men wake up in an abandoned industrial bathroom, each chained to a pipe. Once they find hacksaws in a toilet tank, they attempt to escape from their thick chains, to no avail.That is when a doctor played by Cary Elwes has a realization about their captor that brings the impossible choice of Saw into visceral focus: He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet.Saw, which was released 20 years ago this week, was never supposed to be a success. It was meant as a low-budget calling card for two Australian film students who were looking to start their careers with a scrappy splash and a neat idea: a serial killer who forces his victims to prove they want to stay alive through bloody sacrificial tasks.Instead, it made more than 80 times its budget at the box office, created a horror villain for the new millennium and inspired the label torture porn, with each installment in the ensuing franchise ratcheting up the disgust.It can be hard to remember two decades later that the original Saw was less interested in gore than morality.What would you do to save your life, or someone elses? said the actor Shawnee Smith, summing up the central tension behind the franchises elaborate traps. In order to expediently escape the reverse bear trap enclosing her head in Saw, Smiths character is forced to locate a key inside another persons stomach. He is drowsy but still alive.In Saw, Cary Elwess character verbalizes the tension and appeal of the franchise: He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. LionsgateElwes, known for playing Westley in The Princess Bride, said that Saw had appealed to him because it was a horror story embedded with ethical and moral questions.Its a thinking persons thriller, he said.The germ of the idea that became Saw was a simple one: two men, locked in a room, with a body lying between them. James Wan and Leigh Whannell, film school classmates at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, had been looking to develop their first feature and kicked around ideas until one stuck. They wrote the script together and Wan directed.Wan, who has gone on to make big-budget Hollywood fare as well as unhinged horror flicks, like Insidious and Malignant, said Saw turned classic tropes on their heads.Oh, youve seen that? Oh, you think you know whats going to happen? Wan said from a dingy basement bathroom in London, a fitting homage to Saw and the only place he could get cellphone service while shooting the next installment of The Conjuring franchise there. Im going to try something else you havent seen before.The classic tropes within Saw  serial killers, haunted detectives, creepy puppets  are mashed together and inverted around the undeniable binary of its core choice.Unlike the winking meta horror fare that preceded it, including horror buff Scream teens and Rube Goldberg machinations in Final Destination, no amount of genre knowledge can save the characters of Saw from having to make an ultimate decision.The film critic David Edelstein described Saw and some of its peers  most notably Eli Roths Hostel (2005)  as torture porn in a 2006 New York magazine essay. But the first Saw is not especially gruesome when compared with the deaths punctuating this years Terrifier 3 and In a Violent Nature.To escape the reverse bear trap enclosing her head, Shawnee Smiths character is forced to locate a key inside another persons stomach. LionsgateSaw is more of a detective thriller with a gruesome twist. The titular tool acts as a rusty Chekhovs gun, while the desperation of the characters provides the terror.The franchises traps are devised by the character John Kramer (Tobin Bell), a terminally ill cancer patient who is angry at people for wasting their lives. Kramer, who would eventually be known as Jigsaw, is technically not a serial killer. Every victim is given the choice to live.Deep down inside, although he is of course somewhat ruthless in this approach, Johns in the business of saving souls, Bell said.That framework came out of Whannells personal experience with recurring migraines in his early twenties. While sitting in a waiting room before a CT scan, he wondered how the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor could change someone.The game seemed to be about time, Whannell, who also plays the second man trapped in the bathroom, said of the killers motives. Hes giving them this time limit and hes making them do these extreme things, like, How badly do you want to live?Saw did not have a simple path to creation. When it came time to actually make the movie, Australian financing fell through.Wan and Whannell were ready to scrape together money to film on the cheap, but Whannells manager, Stacey Testro, thought it could work in Hollywood, where she also had an office. Instead of sending her to court producers in the United States with just a script, the writers made a 10-minute short film of the reverse bear trap sequence with Whannell in the rig.Testro remembers watching the short in her living room, with her luggage by the door and a car out front waiting to take her to the airport. It was just thrilling, she said.Producers at Evolution Entertainment  Gregg Hoffman, Oren Koules and Mark Burg  were impressed enough to give Wan and Whannell a $700,000 shooting budget for the chaotic 18-day shoot, which cut costs by filming mostly in the bathroom set. Wan, who had previously focused on stop-motion animation, also handmade Billy the Puppet, an unsettling ventriloquist dummy with red spiral cheeks, a tricycle and the franchises most famous line, I want to play a game.Wan used papier-mch, table tennis balls for Billys eyes and cardboard boxes to fill out a child-size tuxedo for the body. (At first he also had a bowler hat, Wan said, but it looked slightly too silly.)The limited budget did not prevent the movies ideas from resonating with audiences.The first movie was all about ethics and how far can you go and whats right and whats wrong with humanity, Burg said, recalling that Evolution thought Saw would be its version of David Finchers Se7en (1995).Saw was influenced by Se7en, in which Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are detectives chasing a serial killer who punishes his victims with elaborate setups. New Line CinemaWhannell described his goal for Saw as a mix between Se7en and Cube. In Finchers movie, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are detectives chasing down a serial killer who models his murders after the seven deadly sins, punishing his victims via elaborate setups symbolic of their moral failings. In Cube (1997), an offbeat Canadian science fiction horror film, prisoners in a mysterious jail travel through rooms rigged with traps.The extended Saw franchise  the 11th film is scheduled to come out next year  has not always stuck to the ideas put forward by the first movie. Wan never directed another Saw movie, while Whannell contributed to Saw II and wrote the screenplay for Saw III.In the decades since Saw was released, Wan has directed tentpole franchise entries like Aquaman (2018) and Furious 7 (2015). Whannell has also settled into the directors chair, including The Invisible Man (2020) starring Elisabeth Moss and the upcoming Wolf Man, both modern incarnations of classic horror stories.That success all goes back to the two friends as fledgling filmmakers trying to find a story that felt compelling, and then landing on ethical choices with bloody results.Whannell is proudest of the Saw franchises outsize impact on popular culture. His favorite: In The Sopranos, a character becomes fixated on pitching a movie that he describes as Saw meets The Godfather Part II. Billy the Puppet was recently added to the popular battle royale video game Fortnite.Whether we wanted to or not, Whannell said, we basically created the millennial Freddy Krueger.",

It was also one of only a handful of attacks by a foreign air force in Iran since its war with Iraq in the 1980s.Although it was a significant moment, Iran did not immediately set a time frame for a retaliation. The Iranian foreign ministry said that while Iran was obliged to defend itself, it was aware of its responsibilities for regional peace and security, avoiding the kind of bombastic language that characterized Irans initial responses to previous Israeli attacks.That eased fears that an uncontrollable conflict was about to break out, even if the prospect of such a clash has edged ever closer.",

He isnt worse because hes a fascist: If he were, his outspoken opponents would have wound up in prison, not on MSNBC. He isnt worse because his presidency was an unremitting failure: The (prepandemic) economy thrived, Operation Warp Speed was a triumph, the world was more at peace than it is today and there were important diplomatic achievements such as the Abraham Accords. Nor is he the only one who can disrespect political norms: Its Harris, not Trump, who is campaigning on ending the Senate filibuster and perhaps packing the Supreme Court.But Trump is worse in ways that matter profoundly to the rule of law, the health of capitalism and the future of freedom at home and abroad. Conservatives who claim to care about these things should also care about what Trump may do to each of them  and, crucially, do so in the name of conservatism. Consider:Law. Conservatives are indignant about the flimsy civil and criminal cases progressive prosecutors have brought against Trump  cases they almost certainly wouldnt have brought against anyone else.But politicizing justice is exactly what Trump sought to do during his presidency. He tried to strong-arm Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, into participating in a dirt-digging expedition against Joe and Hunter Biden. His Justice Department tried to block a merger between AT&T and Time Warner in 2017, almost certainly out of presidential spite against CNN. He appointed a hack as an acting attorney general and took legal advice from conspiracy theorists, including Sidney Powell.",

In 2000, it took more than a month to determine a winner because of a closely fought race that came down to a recount in Florida, which also involved disputed ballots. In 2020, it took four days to determine that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had defeated the incumbent, President Donald J. Trump. A surge in mail-in voting and closely fought races in several swing states has meant that more votes must be counted before experts can call the race.This election may play out similarly to 2020 because:There is more mail voting and early voting compared with elections before 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic in the 2020 election upended voting patterns for many Americans. So far this year, there are signs that those changes have persisted, with more people voting early and by mail than in previous elections.Most state legislatures prevent counting ballots before Election Day  or even preparing to count them. In Pennsylvania, many voters submit their ballots by mail, but state law prevents election officials from taking steps like verifying signatures and opening envelopes before Election Day. In 2020, it took Pennsylvania four days to determine that Mr. Biden had won the state.Polling also indicates this could be one of the closest elections in history, with the candidates effectively tied across the key battlegrounds. The final result could come down to a few thousand votes in a few swing states, meaning it could be difficult to call the winner in some states before nearly all votes are counted.There are other quirks too. For example, the ballots in Maricopa County, Arizonas most populous region, are spread across two pages this year, requiring election officials to process roughly twice as many pieces of paper compared with 2020. Election officials there said it could take 10 to 13 days to count all the ballots.",

Asked about her former advocacy for giving drivers licenses, college tuition and free health care to undocumented immigrants, she replied, Listen, that was five years ago. Those words hold a valuable lesson for a progressive movement more often heard quoting the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.s famous and rather different declaration that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.Dr. Kings line, originally from a 19th-century abolitionist and preacher named Theodore Parker, has become so embedded in modern American progressivism that President Barack Obama had it woven into an Oval Office rug. Justice, in this thinking, is not some ideologically neutral improvement of the human condition but rather a progressive notion of social justice, greater rights and autonomy and triumph over systemic forces of oppression. History has a right side, and it is the left side.Sure enough, the United States has steadily expanded rights and lifted marginalized groups  making good on what Dr. King called the promissory note of the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. American culture has steadily liberalized  tolerating, then accepting, then welcoming a broadening range of beliefs and identities. Thus the boundless confidence of young activists that whatever radical idea they pursue next will someday become conventional wisdom. Thus, too, the nervous and awkward following along by older progressives, who dare not risk a position that might seem reactionary.But what the moral universes long arc really has is survivorship bias. Progressive causes that achieved success and bettered the nation, like the New Deals worker protections and the civil rights movement of the 1960s, are highly visible today and taught in history books as important inflection points. But for every success, there are also many failures  bold ideas that proved not ahead of their time but simply foolish. Having flickered only briefly in the national consciousness, they are easily forgotten.",

Trumps campaign, which began working with groups funded by billionaires like Elon Musk on a canvassing operation targeting swing state voters in the final days of the campaign.Well know soon whether it was genius or lunacy to put all this in Elon Musks hands, but its bad that you can do it at all, said Tom Moore, who until last year served as chief of staff for a Democratic member of the F.E.C. who opposed the request. Opening the money faucets up as wide as they go strikes me as a bad idea for Democrats, because Republicans just have a bigger faucet.",

On the other side was a call to action: You have the courage and the conviction to vote for Randall Terry.But the mailer did not come from supporters of Mr. Terry, a third-party presidential candidate and longtime leader in the anti-abortion movement.Rather, the fine print showed it was the work of a nascent super PAC with the anodyne name of Civic Truth Action that was funded by millions of dollars in difficult-to-trace money linked to Democrats trying to elect Vice President Kamala Harris as the next president.The final days of a high-stakes election are often a time of political mischief. The message pushed by Civic Truth Action  purportedly to help Mr. Terry but aimed at siphoning votes from former President Donald J. Trump  may be among the most cynical. But it is far from unique. Across the country, supporters of Ms. Harris and Mr. Trump are taking advantage of a patchwork of lax laws that allow partisans to funnel millions of dollars through daisy chains of opaque entities into hard-hitting campaign tactics, all to try to sway the tiny slice of swing-state voters who could make the difference.",

Wade, paving the way for the state abortion bans that have led to often harrowing experiences for many pregnant women denied care.As seismic as that was, activists on both sides of the debate believe a newly elected President Donald J. Trump could go further to effectively ban abortion nationwide  and abortion opponents have given him the road map.It is hard to know what on the anti-abortion agenda Mr. Trump would support. He has shifted his public views on abortion so often that its hard to say what he believes or wants to do. He has said he wants to leave it to the states. More recently, he said he would not sign a federal abortion ban, and would veto one if a Republican-controlled Congress sent it to his desk. He has publicly supported I.V.F., which some anti-abortion groups oppose.But Mr. Trump would also be under pressure from the anti-abortion groups that have ardently supported him to take other actions that would go much further than the 15-week national bans that congressional Republicans have proposed since Roe was overturned. These include reversing federal guidance that says even states with bans must allow doctors to provide abortion in cases of medical emergency; using administrative agencies to ban abortion pills; and using his executive powers to achieve the anti-abortion movements ultimate goal: recognizing fetal personhood in the Constitution.",

The order, which did not include a vote count, gave no reasoning and was unsigned, as is typical in cases decided on the emergency docket. But it noted that Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the states request to continue the voter purge.The case is among a handful of election-related disputes to reach the Supreme Court in the final days before the election. On Tuesday, the justices batted away a bid by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped his independent campaign for the White House in August, to remove his name from the ballots in two crucial battleground states, Michigan and Wisconsin.The voter dispute in Virginia arose in the months before the election, when Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, signed an executive order to hasten the removal of suspected noncitizens from the states voter rolls. In fact, studies show that noncitizens voting is extremely rare, though Republicans, including former President Donald J. Trump and his allies, have continued to deploy the claim.",

            "text": "As the contest for the White House draws to a close, I asked a wide range of scholars and political strategists where they think the blame will go, whether it is Kamala Harris or Donald Trump who wins.Their answers varied widely.William Galston is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Harris, he wrote in an email,has run a surprisingly centrist presidential campaign while the partys progressive wing has bitten its tongue. If she wins, the gloves will come off, and progressives will probably repeat what they did during the first two years of the Biden administration  pressure the new president to support their agenda.But, Galston noted, even if Harris wins,Republicans are likely to take control of the Senate. If so, Harris would be forced to negotiate with a Senate Republican leadership to get anything done, reducing the influence of the left on her administration, and House Democrats would face a choice between gridlock and accepting whatever the administration could get from a Republican-led Senate.How would Harris exercise presidential executive authority?Galston:The answer to this question depends on who she really is  a former progressive mugged by reality and transformed into a Biden Democrat, or an actual progressive who is trimming her sails to close the deal with moderate voters. If its the latter, expect the rule-making process to tilt left, especially on cultural issues. If its the former, the Harris administration will disappoint the left on immigration, crime and education, among other issues.Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, also replied to my queries by email:If Harris wins it will be because she successfully jettisoned the progressive dogma that doomed Democratic primary candidates in the 2020 cycle and made a convincing case to mainstream voters that she is a Democratic centrist. Her decisive move to the center began on the day Joe Biden stepped back from the race and culminated in her convention speech, which was the most centrist of any Democratic nominee in memory, including Bill Clinton in 1992.Harriss embrace, Kessler continued, ofopportunity economics and capitalism helped her close the economy gap with Donald Trump. Her tough on the border policies have closed some of the border gap with Trump. Her accountability and prevention framing and touting her personal gun ownership has helped her on crime. All of these are tier one issues for voters and issues in which Democrats suffered huge deficits.What if Trump wins?Kessler:If Harris loses, progressives will argue publicly that her moving to the center was the cause. Frankly, I dont think even they will believe it. If you watch the swing state ads against Harris or congressional Democrats like Sherrod Brown, they are devastating frontal assaults on progressive liturgy. Every ad is about chaos at the border, out-of-control city streets, runaway inflation and mischaracterizations on transgender issues.How will Republicans react to a Trump defeat?Lets be realistic, Kessler wrote:There are only two outcomes in the minds of the Trump people  he wins or it was stolen from him. What happens to Republicans after a Trump loss will depend on whether enough Republicans tell Trump that they have lost patience with his stolen election charade. If youre counting on courage from congressional Republicans, dont bet the house on it.Ruy Teixeira, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a co-author of The Emerging Democratic Majority, contended that even before the votes have been counted, the progressive movement in the Democratic Party is dead in its tracks. His views of the cultural left are unrelentingly hostile.",

Despite untold sums spent on advertising, a cavalcade of wild events  from felony convictions to assassination attempts to the incumbent president withdrawing from the race  here we sit, right on a razors edge.Over the past few days, other national news outlets have released polls telling the same story. CNN (where I am an on-air contributor) also had the race tied at 47 to 47 among likely voters. CBS News polling shows the contest effectively even, favoring Ms. Harris 50 to 49 among likely voters. (An exception to the pattern, polling by ABC News was a bit more bullish on Ms. Harris, at 51 to 47 among likely voters.)And yet these polls actually dont tell the same story. Though several of them show a dead heat, beneath the surface, they diverge in how they arrive at that result.Lets take two possible theories for how this election might unfold. The first theory, which Ill call the realignment, is that political divides like race and economic class are being replaced by divides like gender and education level. As the Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria writes: We are seeing a realignment in which the old categories of economic status and race are giving way to new categories such as social status and cultural divides around gender. We are likely at the beginning of this transformation of the political landscape.",

When Betts snagged the ball with his glove above the padded wall, Capobianco gripped Betts glove with both hands, opened it, reached inside with his right hand and knocked the ball back onto the field. The umpires ruled the play fan interference and Torres was out.Capobiancos brother, Darren, 29, said he saw Betts glove go over the concrete wall as he tried to make a catch on Torres hit.I just see the ball kind of  I dont want to say (go) up for grabs, if that makes sense, Darren Capobianco said. And then Mookie was swearing at us. Not good.After the game, Betts said that his wrist felt perfectly fine, and he brushed off questions about the incident, which he called irrelevant because the Dodgers lost.It doesnt matter, Betts said, when asked if hed ever seen fans act so aggressively. We lost, its irrelevant, Im fine, hes fine, everythings cool. We lost the game, thats what Im kind of focused on, turn the page. Everythings fine.Austin Capobianco is a Yankee Stadium season-ticket holder, his brother said.Immediately, security guards walked over to Austin Capobianco, who tried to argue with them that Betts glove had reached into foul territory, according to a video obtained by The Athletic. Ana Flamengo, a Yankees fan from Connecticut, said she was standing on the concourse when stadium security escorted Austin Capobianco from the stands.AdvertisementI saw him being walked out, Flamengo said. I told him he was my hero for trying to save the Yankees. Its the championship game.A league spokesperson confirmed that two fans were ejected.That was one of the most aggressive fan ripping the ball out of his glove (incidents) that Ive ever seen, longtime former MLB umpire Dale Scott said.Dodgers pitcher Ben Casparius, who was on the mound at the time, was simply glad that umps called the batter out. Never seen anything like that, he said. It was interesting, especially I think it being the second or third pitch of the game, an interesting start to the game for sure.The Dodgers Tommy Edman didnt care for how the interaction played out.That looked ridiculous from my perspective, Edman said.The guy was trying to yank (Betts) glove off, pulling at his wrist, looked like he got ejected, and Im glad he did. Ive never seen anything like that. That was unacceptable.The Athletics Evan Drellich, Rustin Dodd and Sam Blum contributed to this story.Required reading(Photo: Robert Deutsch / Imagn Images)",

But each time, the 48-year-old lawyer said, he was thwarted, by warnings of gunfire on the roads and, once, when a hired driver disappeared.Then came the Russian soldiers, who searched his house, hauled him off to a nearby village and cast him into a dark cellar where he would undergo a violent, weeklong interrogation.Yevhenys harsh treatment is just one example of a colonialist repression Russia is enforcing across the Ukrainian territory it controls, a system comprising a gulag of more than 100 prisons, detention facilities, informal camps and basements that is reminiscent of the worst Soviet excesses.Research by a team of reporters involving dozens of interviews with former detainees, human rights organizations and Ukrainian officials from the Office of the General Prosecutor, the intelligence service and ombudsmen, reveals a highly institutionalized, bureaucratic and frequently brutal system of repression run by Moscow to pacify an area of 40,000 square miles in Ukraine, roughly the size of Ohio.",

            "text": "NEW YORK  Anthony Volpes jersey was caked in dirt as he fielded grounders at shortstop before the ninth inning of Game 4 of the World Series. The New York Yankees were on the brink of a victory that would keep their season alive.Then, the most exhilarating moment of Volpes life unfolded.Like many kids who grew up playing baseball in the New York area, Volpe dreamed of becoming the Yankees shortstop and a franchise icon like his hero, Derek Jeter. While the odds of such a dream coming true are nearly impossible, Volpe now lives it every day.AdvertisementHis deep-rooted Yankees fandom spans generations. His great-grandfather immigrated from Italy and made a living selling fruit from a pushcart in downtown Manhattan. He later fought in World War II and returned home with shrapnel wounds. Volpes grandfather was just 4 years old when his father went to war, and upon his return, they bonded over Yankees games on the radio. Every night, trying to make up for lost time, the two would share stories of life and baseball.Growing up, Volpe wore No. 7 in honor of his grandfathers idol, Mickey Mantle. So Tuesday night embodied a dream fulfilled for Volpe and his ancestors. He launched a go-ahead grand slam in the third inning, giving the Yankees a 5-2 lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also stole two bases, becoming the first Yankee to hit a grand slam and steal multiple bases in a game  regular season or postseason  since none other than Mantle.But the moment that stood out the most came with the Yankees leading 11-4 in the ninth inning. Nearly 50,000 fans at Yankee Stadium erupted and began chanting Vol-pe! Vol-pe! Vol-pe! He turned toward the Bleacher Creatures and saluted them, striving to maintain his composure. Deep down, the 23-year-old was experiencing the pinnacle of his lifes journey.Number one, Volpe exclaimed with pure joy. Definitely number one.Yankee Stadium hadnt erupted like it did Tuesday in 15 years, not since Game 6 of the 2009 World Series. Shortly after that victory, an 8-year-old Volpe watched the championship parade with his family, dreaming of one day parading down the Canyon of Heroes as fans chanted his name the same way he did for Jeter.Fifteen years later, on the set of Foxs postgame show, Jeter playfully ribbed Volpe, suggesting he should have been in school instead of at the parade.AdvertisementBut with the Yankees down 3-1 in the World Series and history against them, Volpe admitted he hadnt fully grasped the significance of Tuesday night.Hopefully, when we win the World Series and Im with my family, we can reflect on everything, Volpe said. It was just a big game. We wanted to go 1-0 today and see where it takes us.Volpe envisioned nights like Tuesday probably every night as a child. He doesnt take for granted that this dream was shared by his friends, his cousins, and his sister, Olivia. But winning the World Series always loomed as his top aspiration.Anthony Volpe could only dream of nights like Tuesday, only this time, he made it a reality. (Sarah Stier / Getty Images)Nothing else compares, Volpe said. So theres still a lot of work to do.Austin Wells, Volpes best friend on the team, felt the ground shake when Volpe hit his grand slam. The two had often discussed what this moment would feel like if they reached this stage together.Wells spent countless nights at Volpes childhood home, poring over old Yankees footage and imagining the electric atmosphere of an October crowd at Yankee Stadium. On Tuesday, he experienced it, hitting a solo home run into the second deck to extend the Yankees lead to 6-4. Earlier, he smacked a double with Volpe on second base; although Volpes base-running blunder may have cost the Yankees an additional run, it ultimately didnt matter as the offense finally broke through against the Dodgers bullpen.Los Angeles opted not to use its high-leverage relievers, believing it will certainly win one of the next three games, rendering a Game 4 loss moot. However, the Yankees faced a must-win scenario. If the Yankees mount a comeback, it will surely deserve its own Netflix documentary, like the Red Sox one on the streaming platform now, and the offensive explosion led by Volpes grand slam in Game 4 should be its starting point.We were down 2-0, but we still said, Hey, this aint gonna be easy, but this is what were made for,' Jazz Chisholm Jr. said. Who doesnt want to make history? I love making history. I love writing my name in the history books.After Game 4, Volpe spent a few moments with the Fox postgame crew, where David Ortiz, well-acquainted with comebacks from 3-0 deficits, gifted Volpe a shirt featuring Big Papi in a Red Sox jersey with the caption, My Dawg! Volpe chuckled, insisting he wouldnt ever wear it, knowing it would be sacrilegious to don Boston gear.AdvertisementYet, even more meaningful than the shirt were Jeters words on set. In the same way he idolized Jeter, countless New York kids now aspire to be like Volpe, dreaming of one day hitting a grand slam in the World Series at Yankee Stadium as the franchises shortstop.And perhaps, if theyre lucky, theyll one day recount how that grand slam led to baseball immortality.(Top photo: Sarah Stier / Getty Images)",

Trumps administration  especially his generals, ambassadors and other national security officials  have since turned on Mr. Trump.Former President Donald J. Trump often brags about hiring the best people. But the breadth of the criticism aimed at Mr. Trump, especially from his own former military and national security officials, sets him apart from any modern president.Gen. Mark Milley Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman John Kelly Chief of staff John Bolton National security adviser Nikki Haley U.N. ambassador Rex Tillerson Secretary of state Mike Pompeo Secretary of state Play John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general who served as Mr. Trumps chief of staff, recently called his former boss an authoritarian, saying he admires people who are dictators  he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.Mark Milley, the countrys top military official during the last two years of Mr. Trumps presidency, privately told the journalist Bob Woodward that Mr. Trump is a fascist to the core and said his pursuit of another four years in office makes him the most dangerous person to this country, Mr. Woodward revealed in a recent book.Mr. Trump and those around him rejected the criticism as little more than sour grapes. The former president has called General Milley a loser and worse, and has suggested that the decorated military officer should be executed for treason because of efforts to ease concerns among foreign leaders after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by Mr. Trumps supporters.But the comments from Mr. Kelly and General Milley denigrating Mr. Trumps capacity to serve as commander in chief are particularly striking, even as they echo the sentiments from others across his government and many Republicans outside of his administration.Former generals, admirals, diplomats, intelligence officers and security strategists have publicly or privately accused Mr. Trump of being a liar who lacks basic knowledge about the world and represents a danger to democracy. Members of his cabinet have questioned his loyalty to the country and testified to his chaotic behavior. His press aides have talked about his lack of integrity and his tendency to attack others.And Mike Pence, his own vice president, has accused him of being reckless and putting himself over the Constitution. And Mr. Pence said he walked away from the agenda backed by conservatives. Mr. Pence ran against Mr. Trump and refused to endorse him.Only a few of the former presidents advisers have played an active role in trying to defeat Mr. Trumps bid for another four years in power, often citing their belief that military and national security officials should not meddle in partisan politics. Most have not appeared in ads or sat for recent TV interviews. Just a handful have endorsed Mr. Trumps opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.But they have not disowned their comments about the former president and the danger he poses if he returns to the Oval Office. In recent weeks, Ms. Harris has begun running campaign ads citing the comments from some of the former Trump officials as evidence that he is unfit to serve again.Mr. Trump could regain power soon, and those who advised him the first time have said he is A Threat to Democracy Mr. Trumps national security aides repeatedly described him as a danger to the country and to democracy. Many cited the Jan. 6 violence and his reaction to it as evidence of how he posed a threat to the countrys laws and norms. Others predicted a return to the White House would damage the countrys national security. Surely you cant mean Hitlers generals? And he said, Yeah, yeah, Hitlers generals. John Kelly Chief of staff , said in a recent interview, recalling when Mr. Trump praised the loyalty shown by German generals. Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people  does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. James Mattis Secretary of defense Donald Trump will cause a lot of damage if he is elected in a second term. John Bolton National security adviser The American people deserve to know that President Trump asked me to put him over my oath to the Constitution, but I kept my oath and I always will. Im running for president in part because I think that anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States. Mike Pence Vice presidentIll-Informed and Incurious Several officials have publicly questioned Mr. Trumps intelligence, accusing him of knowing little about history and saying they observed him struggling to understand the complexities of the presidency. Some said he appeared not to be interested in learning about the issues he confronted. Trump lacked basic knowledge of how the government runs, and his impatience with learning about the roles of his senior officials and about alternative models for decision-making limited his ability to lead. When there was conflict, he avoided it or, at times, stoked it. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser His understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of U.S. history was really limited. Its really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesnt even understand the concept for why were talking about this. Rex Tillerson Secretary of state His short attention span (except on matters of personal advantage) renders coherent foreign policy almost unattainable. The United States missed an incalculable number of opportunities in Trumps first term because senior officials necessarily concentrated on keeping a few key policies on track. John Bolton National security adviserDishonest Some members of Mr. Trumps national security team accused him of lying while he was president. Several said he fabricated stories or willingly ignored facts. Others said they witnessed him lying about the results of the 2020 election despite knowing the truth. Trump was caught in a vortex created by the interaction of those narratives with the fragility of his ego and his deep sense of aggrievement. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser Our president must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country. The most important being truth. This president is not able to do that. James Comey F.B.I. director , said after Mr. Trump fired him from his job So many people who had access to his ear who were telling him things, most of which were untrue, and then he began to listen to those voices and form a view that had no basis in fact. Rex Tillerson Secretary of stateMisplaced in His Loyalty Some former aides said Mr. Trump was not loyal to his constituents because he failed to follow a standard conservative agenda. Many questioned his loyalty to the country after witnessing his actions after the election of 2020. Others said he proved disloyal by ignoring rules that govern how sensitive documents are handled. His ego and love of self distorted his perception of the 2020 presidential election. His sense of betrayal drove him to abandon his oath to support and defend the Constitution, a presidents highest obligation. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser He thought I would be loyal and obedient to him. I told him we were loyal to our oath to the Constitution. If he told you to slit someones throat, he thought you would go out and do it. John Kelly White House chief of staff The president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices. Richard Spencer Secretary of the NavyDisorderly and Undisciplined National security advisers and military officials working for Mr. Trump said he created political and diplomatic chaos while in office. Some said they believed he enjoyed causing discord, while others said he pursued policies that triggered strife and disagreement among global allies. Some said he had a temper that added to the sense of chaos. He acts on his instincts. In some respects, that looks like impulsiveness, but its not his intent to act on impulse. I think he really is trying to act on his instincts. Rex Tillerson Secretary of state Hes getting meaner and more offensive by the day. Hes trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. Nikki Haley U.N. ambassador , said while she was running against Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. John Kelly White House chief of staffA Lawbreaker Several of his national security advisers noted that Mr. Trump faces multiple indictments , including federal charges that he sought to overturn the 2020 election. He has denied breaking the law in all of the cases. This is beyond wrong and illegal. Its un-American. The President undermined American democracy baselessly for months. Tom Bossert Homeland security adviser , said after the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6 Ive never seen a defendant beg for it more. By attacking the judge, attacking the jury, attacking the witnesses. James Comey F.B.I. director , said when asked if Mr. Trump would be sentenced to jail time after being convicted of falsifying business records. Todays violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump. James Mattis Secretary of defenseLacking in Integrity One common theme among the former presidents most senior military and national security officials was what some described as a lack of integrity. Several said he was motivated only by self-interest, rather than what was good for the country or the government. Others commented on his ego or used the word unfit to describe him. I think hes unfit for office.  He puts himself before country. His actions are all about him and not about the country. Mark Esper Secretary of defense The facts, however, are clear that he is unfit to be President. If his first four years were bad, a second four will be worse, dismaying many ardent supporters. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty. James Comey F.B.I. directorSimilar warnings about Mr. Trump have come from his other top advisers: almost half of his cabinet, as well as his attorney general, among others. These officials rang the alarm both during and after Mr. Trumps presidency  in books, interviews, essays, speeches and television appearances.People who once worked for Mr. Trump at the highest levels now describe him as unintelligent, chaotic, a danger to American democracy and more. What follows is not an exhaustive list, but rather a representative collection of criticism from Mr. Trumps top advisers.",

            "text": "NEW YORK  The hometown kid came to the rescue on Tuesday, saving the New York Yankees from elimination in the World Series.Anthony Volpe, the New York-born shortstop who attended the Yankees last championship parade in 2009 as an 8-year-old, belted a go-ahead grand slam in the third inning of Game 4, powering the Yankees to a 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Bronx.AdvertisementThe Yankees  who got four critical outs from Luke Weaver  became the first team since 1970 to force a Game 5 after losing the first three games of the World Series. The last nine teams facing that deficit had been eliminated in Game 4.Freddie Freeman set a record in defeat, becoming the first player to hit homers in six consecutive World Series games, a streak that began with Atlanta in 2021. Freeman lined a two-run bullet to right in the first inning for the second game in a row, but the Dodgers failed in their effort to clinch the title with a bullpen game.Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers never got much going and the Yankees pulled away with a late offensive explosion. (Elsa / Getty Images)Analyzing the bullpen decisionsHeres the thing with how the Dodgers approached their bullpen game, particularly the third inning: Its largely in line with what worked for them in the National League Championship Series against the Mets when they ran this same playbook twice. The Dodgers got about what they expected out of Ben Casparius. They knew they would need multiple innings out of Landon Knack. Even though everyone was available for the Dodgers, using some of their top arms would have changed the calculus of how they approached a potential Game 5.Having Daniel Hudson take on the heart of the Yankees order brought understandable risk. His production faded over the season, largely because of his propensity for allowing the long ball. It was Volpe  not Juan Soto, Aaron Judge nor even Giancarlo Stanton  who took him out of the ballpark, but there were going be stretches in Game 4 when the Dodgers had to grit their teeth. Hudson clearly didnt have his command despite striking out the scariest matchup in Soto.Knack, warming up as the inning built, was a long-term play. Using another righty for Volpe with the bases loaded wouldve burned another arm for a pocket of left-handed hitters, and using one of their two lefties would have set up a less-than-ideal platoon spot. Using a leverage arm would have ramifications for a potential Game 5 and beyond.AdvertisementSo Hudson faced Volpe. He hung a slider. Volpe had struggled this postseason but did not miss his chance.Yankees provide a formula for a historic comebackThe Yankees had not gotten much production from the bottom of the order in the first three games of the World Series. Entering Game 4, the Yankees 7-8-9 batters had a combined four hits. On Tuesday, they combined for four hits through the first six innings.Volpe delivered that critical grand slam in the third inning, giving the Yankees a 5-2 lead. It was Volpes first home run since Sept. 21 and a reminder that he has power when he connects on a pitch. Volpe abandoned the power approach he showcased in his rookie season so he could increase his contact in Year 2. That decision backfired as he was a worse overall hitter. But for one night, Volpe turned back the clock and became the power-hitting shortstop the Yankees thought he would become.Austin Wells, who has struggled mightily over the past two months, smoked two batted balls. In the second inning, he hit a 406-foot double to center field that would have been gone in 17 ballparks. Wells then hit the ball over the fence in the sixth inning to give the Yankees a 6-4 lead.If the Yankees were to mount a historic comeback in this series, part of the formula is getting production up and down their lineup like they did in Game 4.Dodgers havent maximized their extra looks at the Yankees bullpenFor as much as the Dodgers have seen the Yankees bullpen, they have yet to accomplish what they usually do: take advantage of multiple looks, adjust and find the soft spots to break through. The Dodgers again chased a Yankee starter before he could complete the fifth inning, as Aaron Boone removed Luis Gil before the pitcher faced Shohei Ohtani a third time through the order. Ohtani immediately laced a single off Tim Hill and the Dodgers got two runs in the inning, but New Yorks bullpen wound up going the final five innings allowing zero runs.AdvertisementThrough four games this series, the Dodgers have managed 12 runs off Yankees starters in 16 innings. In 19 2/3 innings against the Yankees bullpen, theyve scored six  and just one since their furious comeback in Game 1. The prevailing theory is that seeing more out of a bunch of relievers should favor the hitters, particularly with fatigue setting in within a series. Its gone the wrong direction on the Dodgers hitters, which kept Games 2 and 3 from being bigger routs and impeded the Dodgers ability to come back in Game 4.Bullpen, Luke Weaver save the dayCloser Luke Weaver pulled off an incredible feat, tearing through the heart of the Dodgers order for four outs, and the rest of the relievers picked up starting pitcher Gil, who lasted just four innings.Weaver entered with two outs and a runner on second base in the seventh with the Yankees ahead 6-4. He immediately struck out Mookie Betts with a runner on second base. In the eighth inning, Weaver continued to dominate, retiring the side by getting Freeman to pop out and striking out Teoscar Hernndez and Max Muncy.Hill (2/3 innings), Clay Holmes (1 1/3 innings) and Mark Leiter Jr. (2/3 innings) combined to be the bridge to Weaver.In the ninth  with a seven-run lead thanks to a five-run eighth-inning rally  Tim Mayza finished things off with a 1-2-3 ninth.The Yankees will undoubtedly go into Wednesday with a tired bullpen. But facing elimination, all bets are off regarding whether Boone will rest anyone. If the Yankees can prevail, they will have Thursdays off day to recover before Game 6 on Friday in Los Angeles. Fortunately for them, they will start ace Gerrit Cole, who has been a workhorse throughout his career but hasnt topped 89 pitches in any of his four starts this postseason.(Top photo of Anthony Volpe: Elsa / Getty Images)",

            "text": "NEW YORK  One more day of summer. For every team faced with an early demise in the World Series, thats the vision: one more day of summer to play with your friends. Youll have to face the winter soon enough.So on Tuesday afternoon, under steel-gray skies in the steel-gray fortress of Yankee Stadium, Anthony Rizzo gave voice to what all of his teammates were thinking.AdvertisementToday could be our last drive to the ballpark, said Rizzo, the veteran first baseman. Today could be the last time this teams ever together.The everyday rhythms are part of baseballs charm, the routine a source of comfort in a game so capricious. The New York Yankees did not think they had played very badly in this World Series, yet theyd lost the first three games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. No team in the last half-century had faced that deficit and won another game.We were down 2-0 and we said, Hey, this ss not gonna be easy, but this is what were made for, third baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. said. We lost Game 3 and we said, Hey, who doesnt want to make history? I know I love making history. I love writing my name in the history books and being a part of it. So lets do it.After thumping the Dodgers, 11-4, these Yankees have lots of chiseling to do before carving their place in history as the only team to win the World Series after losing the first three games.But what you heard in their clubhouse after Game 4 was the sound of hope, of a plausible scenario for a singular achievement. On Wednesday, Rizzo noted, the Yankees will face Jack Flaherty and the Dodgers cast of high-leverage relievers. Theyve seen them all before, and theyll be ready.The flight to L.A. will be really special if we make that happen, Rizzo said.Eight years ago with the Chicago Cubs, Rizzo played another Game 5 on Halloween eve, needing a win to extend the World Series. The Cubs trusted an ace starter, Jon Lester, and a well-rested closer, Aroldis Chapman, for a win that clinched a final road trip for a tight group. The Cubs would return from Cleveland as champions.Now the Yankees can use their top starter, Gerrit Cole, to start Game 5, with relief ace Luke Weaver relatively fresh after throwing only 21 pitches Tuesday. The Yankees five-run rally in the eighth padded their lead and saved Weaver from working another inning.Gleyber Torres three-run homer was the big blow then, but the preceding at-bat had the Yankees buzzing. With one out and runners at second and third, Alex Verdugo wore down Brent Honeywell Jr. for 11 pitches. His bouncer to second scored Anthony Volpe and set up the blast that followed.I know he probably didnt put up the numbers in the regular season that he wanted to, Aaron Judge, who was 1 for 3, said of Verdugo. But all year long he just said: Get me to the postseason and Ill do something special. And thats what weve seen so far this whole postseason.Verdugo hasnt actually been Reggie Jackson; hes hitting .200/.280/.311 in October, even worse than his regular season numbers (.233/.291/.356). But his one home run this month came with two on and two outs in the ninth inning of Game 3  a jolt of confidence for a slumbering offense.AdvertisementThe Dodgers started Game 4 just as they had the night before, with a two-run homer by Freddie Freeman in the top of the first. But while it was the same kind of hit, this one packed less punch. The Yankees were too awestruck to be discouraged.My first thought is: this guy is superhuman, Weaver said. Youre sitting there kind of marveling at what hes doing. So youve got to give him all the respect and appreciation for what hes doing on the biggest stage. But, I mean, youre looking at it and its early, right? Youre not like, Oh, its a repeat.It was an all-new episode with a mostly fresh cast of Dodgers pitchers. Three of them were new to this World Series and covered seven innings. The pitcher the Yankees had seen already, Daniel Hudson, allowed Volpes go-ahead grand slam in the third.It really just takes one big swing, and I feel like that was Volpes big swing there, said catcher Austin Wells, who doubled and homered like Volpe. It allowed everyone to just take a deep breath and have fun. I think also the situation we were in, we just kind of needed to say screw it and go after it and have fun because some guys may never come back to the World Series again.Volpe sure had fun; by the end, his muddy uniform was so brown that youd think he played for the San Diego Padres. He lived the fantasy of every New York-born kid of his generation: a shortstop in pinstripes, starring in the World Series. He could get used to this extra month of work.Its my first playoffs, but these have been probably the craziest things Ive ever been a part of, Volpe said. So its just foot on the gas, always.The Yankees stalled for three games. Now the engine is purring. Theyre still tracing a narrow path on the edge of a cliff, trying to do what no team has ever done: not just winning the World Series after losing the first three games, but simply forcing a Game 6.AdvertisementMaybe theyll make history. Maybe  probably  they wont. But theyre still playing, and thats the best they can do for now.I feel like today is a reminder to show you why were in the World Series, why we got this far, Chisholm said, and why we dont expect to be done.(Top photo of the Yankees bench celebrating Gleyber Torres home run in Game 4: Elsa / Getty Images)",

His administration hastened a vaccine for Covid-19 with one hand and then fostered doubt about using it with the other when it met with a conservative anti-vaccine backlash.Today, Trumps first priority is not capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities that will come from America leading in the use of A.G.I. nor building a global coalition to govern it, but to impose higher tariffs on our allies to block their exports of cars and toys and other goods to the United States. The only technology Trump seems to be deeply interested in is Truth Social, his own version of X. Indeed, since Trump has described himself as a very stable genius, he probably doubts that there could even be an artificial intelligence greater than his own.Kamala Harris, given her background in law enforcement, connections to Silicon Valley and the work she has already done on A.I. in the past four years, is up to this challenge, which is a key reason she has my endorsement for the presidency.",

His music is poetic, emotionally direct even in its stranger moments and suggestive of deep vulnerability: a unique and potent combination.

I came offstage feeling altered, as I so often do after performing Schumanns music  as if I had seen his innermost self and, in the process, accessed my own. Moments later, in the green room, I heard the questions Ive grown accustomed to but still steel myself against: Had Schumann already gone mad when he wrote this work? Can I hear the madness in the music?Schumann did indeed suffer from severe mental illness; he was institutionalized for the last years of his life. And there is no denying that as his condition worsened, the character of his music changed: It turned inward and grew increasingly static, still conveying his essence but somehow more aloof from the listener. And yet these questions always bother me. They reduce this beautiful, complicated, staggeringly gifted person to a pathology.More dangerously, they indicate a persistent and pernicious stereotype: the tortured artist. Think of the popular conception of the raging Beethoven, the anguished van Gogh, the volatile Caravaggio, the idiosyncratic Vladimir Horowitz, the guitar-smashing rock star.",

            "text": "Donald Trumps rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night was supposed to be the capstone event of his campaign, a triumphant celebration of authoritarian strength. With millions watching, he would march into the final week of the contest as a conquering champion, so popular he could fill an arena in deep-blue New York twice over.Having energized his most fervent supporters, he would send them out to do whatever it took to return him to the White House. That was the idea, at least. But what works in theory does not always deliver in practice, and in practice, Trumps climactic rally at Madison Square Garden was nothing short of a disaster.Did Trump have the crowds he wanted? Yes. But that was the extent of his success that night. His overall message was dark, disturbing and as autocratic as you might expect from a man whose top officials have been warning us about his fascistic tendencies. Were running against a massive, crooked, malicious leftist machine thats running the Democrat Party, Trump said. They are smart and vicious, they are the enemy within, we must defeat them.Overshadowing the crude authoritarianism of Trumps remarks, however, were those of nearly every other speaker at the podium, who illustrated  each in his own way  the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the MAGA movement. There was, of course, the comedian from Texas who let loose a string of offensive jokes aimed at Blacks and Latinos, relishing the permissive atmosphere. Unfortunately for Trump, one of those jokes was an anti-Puerto Rican remark so racist that it galvanized some of the most prominent figures in Puerto Rican cultural life (This is what they think of us, Ricky Martin wrote in Spanish to his millions of followers on Instagram) and may have jeopardized the campaigns standing in Pennsylvania, where hundreds of thousands of Hispanic Americans of Puerto Rican descent live.",

The divide is pretty arbitrary, more culturally than scientifically defined. So, is it fair to say that there are actually only six continents?That is just the first slippery step on a well-oiled slope. What about North America and Asia?They are connected by the Bering Sea Shelf, once dry land crossed by humans and flooded only in the geologically recent past. Technically speaking, that makes Asia, North America and Europe all one continent. Does that mean there are only five?Other experts contend that five, six and seven are wrong and argue in favor of eight continents. There are even those who go as far as to say there are only two.",

The countrys political system survived his first term, after all, and many Americans understandably wonder how much different a second term would be.It really could be different.Trump is now far better positioned to accomplish his goals, as my colleagues Maggie Haberman, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Swan have explained in a series of stories. His aides are vetting job candidates for loyalty, trying to exclude establishment Republicans who might resist his wishes. Both Congress and the judiciary would likely be friendlier to him than they were eight years ago.In todays newsletter, I want to help you understand the main ways that Trump could undermine democratic traditions.

Trump raged at his military and legal advisers, calling them losers for objecting to his idea of using federal troops to suppress outbreaks of violence during the nationwide protests over the police murder of George Floyd.It wasnt the only time Mr. Trump was talked out of using the military for domestic law enforcement  a practice that would carry profound implications for civil liberties and for the traditional constraints on federal power. He repeatedly raised the idea of using troops to secure border states, and even proposed shooting both violent protesters and undocumented migrants in the legs, former aides have said.In his first term in office, Mr. Trump never realized his expansive vision of using troops to enforce the law on U.S. soil. But as he has sought a return to power, he has made clear that he intends to use the military for a range of domestic law enforcement purposes, including patrolling the border, suppressing protests that he deems to have turned into riots and even fighting crime in big cities run by Democrats.In places where there is a true breakdown of the rule of law, such as the most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago, the next president should use every power at his disposal to restore order  and, if necessary, that includes sending in the National Guard or the troops, Mr. Trump said at a conservative conference in Dallas in August 2022, shortly before announcing that he was running to be that next president.",

Abdur-Rahim was 43.The school said in a statement that complications arose during his treatment at a Tampa-area hospital.All of us with South Florida Athletics are grieving with the loved ones of Coach Abdur-Rahim, athletic director Michael Kelly said in a statement. He was authentic, driven, and his infectious personality captivated all of Bulls Nation. Coach Abdur-Rahim leaves a lasting impact on our student-athletes, the University, and the community.AdvertisementAbdur-Rahim was seen as a rising star in the profession and a potential major program coach. He led a remarkable turnaround in his first season with the Bulls last year, earning unanimous American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year honors. He coached South Florida to a school-record 25 victories, its first regular-season conference title ever, its first appearance in the polls and its first NIT appearance in more than a decade.Before taking over the Bulls in March 2023, Abdur-Rahim, a Georgia native, guided Kennesaw State to 26 wins and its first trip to the NCAA Tournament after the program went 1-28 in his first season at the helm (2019-20).The Southeastern Louisiana graduate also spent time as an assistant at Georgia and Texas A&M.In a very short time, Coach Abdur-Rahim made an indelible impact on the University of South Florida, school president Rhea Law said. Throughout my time working with Coach Abdur-Rahim, I was continually inspired by his leadership, and truly admired his sincere approach to connecting with our entire student body. His influence on our student-athletes, coaching staff and the university community will live on forever.Corey Staniscia witnessed Abdur-Rahims influence and sincere connections firsthand as the director of the Bulls Fowler Ave Collective. Abdur-Rahim sent random supportive text messages. More than once, he hung around the campus Starbucks and put students drinks on his tab.The last time Staniscia saw him, he asked how the team was jelling. Abdur-Rahims answer: Im getting them to love each other.That man loved his athletes and what he did, Staniscia said. He truly did care about them.We couldnt have asked for a better person to be here.Abdur-Rahim is survived by his wife, Arianne Buchanan, and three children, Laila, Lana and Aydin. His older brother, Shareef, was a longtime forward in the NBA.Abdur-Rahims death comes less than a week before South Floridas scheduled exhibition against Edward Waters. The school did not announce an interim coach.(Photo: Chris Jones / Imagn Images)",

The list of Ukrainian cities and towns largely leveled to the ground by Russian bombs and artillery grows with each passing month.Russian forces have moved forward in small increments, sustaining a staggering number of casualties to take cities like Avdiivka, which Moscow captured in February. They are now closing in on the nearby city of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian stronghold in the east.In recent months, the fighting has spread to the Russian-Ukrainian border area. In early May, Russian forces launched an offensive in Ukraines northeast, seizing several settlements in a push near the city of Kharkiv. In August, the Ukrainian Army crossed into Russias western Kursk region in a surprise assault that brought the war into the Russian territory in a way never before seen, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to evacuate.Away from the front, millions of Ukrainians have spent hours in bomb shelters as Russia rains down missiles and drones on military units and civilians across the nation. Ukraines energy grid, severely damaged, is working but sporadically. Thousands of schools, hospitals and cultural institutions have been damaged or destroyed. Millions have lost their homes.For all that time, photographers with The New York Times and other news organizations have chronicled the war, capturing a slice of how soldiers and civilians have experienced it. Some images, our photographers say, will never leave them.",

But broken up by gender and education, we see that the gaps are driven particularly by men without a college degree and women with a college degree, with an overall difference of 43 points. Source: Pew Research, survey of U.S. adults conducted from Sept. 30 to Oct. 6, 2024.We are truly looking at two different Americas when we dig into the views of men without college degrees and women with college degrees. They are at opposite ends of the spectrum politically and experience essentially separate economies, and therefore give priority to distinct sets of character traits and issues.Lets take a closer look. Women with college degrees, who are generally more financially secure than other women, name abortion as one of the key issues deciding their vote, while both women and men without degrees tend to focus more on issues affecting their day-to-day finances or safety. While inflation affects everyone, it hits non-college-educated voters who feel they are falling behind hardest, especially now that the unemployment rate has been rising among those with less than a high school diploma.Our research indicates that economic issues matter deeply to many men without a college degree, who respond strongly to populist messages aimed at acknowledging their anxiety, sense of loss and resentment.These two groups also consume media in entirely different ways, which affects what they see and hear. Men  including those without college degrees  often spend time on X and Reddit, and many listen to podcasts and YouTube personalities concentrating on gaming, sports and politics. Women are more likely to frequent TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. Many seem more focused on content about personal growth, true crime and style.With the contrasts in priorities and worldview between these two groups, it makes sense that they would have different voting patterns, and the presence of a woman on the Democratic ticket has only accentuated that. Recent polling by the Pew Research Center shows non-college-educated men choosing Mr. Trump at a rate of 55 percent to 39 percent; college-educated women are nearly the inverse, favoring Ms. Harris by 61 percent to 34 percent. The gap may be even bigger by Election Day; it could be the largest in history.The large split between non-college-educated men and college-educated women began in 2016 +20 R (poll) Non-college men +10 R 0 43 pt. gap +10 D 39 pt. gap 41 pt. gap +20 D College women +30 D KerrY Bush Obama McCain Obama Romney Clinton Trump Biden Trump Harris Trump +40 D 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 +20 Rep.

KerrY Bush Obama McCain Obama Romney Clinton Trump Biden Trump Harris Trump +40 Dem. 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 Sources: American National Election Studies, Pew ResearchThis isnt a new trend. College-educated women have consistently voted for Democrats at high levels for years. But the divergence between non-college-educated men and college-educated women this year seems likely to surpass even its 2016 level.Mr. Trumps appeal to non-college-educated men is part of whats driving this shift. Before 2016, the gap between college-educated women and non-college-educated men was not as broad. But while Joe Biden made inroads among non-college-educated men in 2020, gaining 5 percent more of their vote compared to Hillary Clintons share in 2016, current support for Ms. Harris among men without college degrees has dropped back down almost to Mrs. Clintons 2016 levels. This could certainly in part be due to gender biases; non-college-educated men tend to be less receptive to the idea of women in executive positions. A study found that men without college degrees are least confident that a woman has what it takes to run a major American company (78 percent are confident compared to 91 percent of college-educated women). Our research suggests that they worry whether women are strong enough, can be respected by foreign leaders and are able to boost manufacturing.This campaign in particular shows that both parties have problems with key demographics. Years ago, Democrats could count on support from male union workers, but Mr. Trump is increasingly winning over those voters  not only because of his direct, emotional appeals to their anxiety and values, but also because Democrats have struggled to establish a compelling enough populist economic message or break into the media ecosystem that non-college-educated men consume.Mr. Trumps running mate, JD Vance, seems to have an especially potent attraction for some of these working-class voters. Increasingly, Republicans are the party of working- and middle-class people, said Mr. Vance, whose familys working-class background could be a powerful tool to bring in these non-college-educated men who turned to Mr. Biden in 2020, particularly white ones.As for Ms. Harris, she is particularly appealing to educated women. Republicans used to be stronger than Democrats with college-educated women, but that started to change in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan. Contemporaneous research indicated that educated women were more secular and more progressive on social issues than other voters at the time. They also supported government programs to provide a safety net and opportunity for all (sound familiar?). They opposed the Reagan tax cuts and deregulation and feared war. But many stuck with the Republican Party through the 2000s as part of the security mom coalition. We saw echoes of this in 2022 when Republican candidates in New York and elsewhere were able to leverage safety concerns to win over enough of these women to prevail on Election Day.Donald Trump on Joe Rogans podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, via YoutubeKamala Harris on Bren Browns podcast Bren Brown, via FacebookMs. Harris has been able to use abortion rights to bring back some women with college degrees who might otherwise have stayed with the Republicans. She already had a record of defending reproductive rights, and this year, she visited swing states to speak about abortion. Even in the early days of her campaign, she focused on abortion rights, vowing to restore the rights that had been enshrined in Roe v. Wade and organizing events in battleground states devoted to the issue. Women with college degrees were already a core base for Ms. Harris and the Democratic Party, but these moves helped increase her support among women of all ages. She and her campaign know that she needs to register and turn out voters who favor abortion rights to offset the non-college-educated men Mr. Trump is poised to win.While it might seem impossible for a candidate to appeal to both non-college-educated men and college-educated women, there are areas where policies and messaging could bridge the gap.A populist message, for example, could win more men without college degrees without alienating college-educated women, as anti-corporate sentiment is common among voters across the political spectrum and can play into concerns about both economic issues and freedom from control. Either party could leverage this sentiment.Both groups seem to want investments in public education and job skills training. Many in both groups are worried the next generation will not be as well off as the one before. Many want clean air and water and worry about pollution. Non-college-educated men tend to want to preserve natural areas for recreation like hunting, our data indicates, while college-educated women are particularly concerned about climate change. Both groups seek more respect and power, our research shows, and both see politics as a zero-sum game. The divide between these two groups seems unlikely to change before Election Day, but for either party to bridge the gap in the long term, it will need to work to appeal to both groups.The story of this election could well be the gender gap between those Americans who went to college and those who didnt. As the candidates consolidate support among their base, the divide between college-educated women and non-college-educated men seems almost impossible for Ms. Harris or Mr. Trump to overcome. The big question for America going forward is, can these two groups be brought together after a campaign that has only driven them further apart?Celinda Lake, president of Lake Research Partners, was one of two lead pollsters for Joe Bidens 2020 presidential campaign.

            "text": "Jaxson Darts feathered blond hair was tucked under a black hoodie, zipped tightly to his chin. Stone-faced, the quarterback couldnt stop shaking his head in disbelief.I dont understand how we lost, he said.We should win that game, coach Lane Kiffin said.Ole Miss had already suffered a loss to Kentucky. This one landed harder.AdvertisementWe have followed a plan that was deliberate and intentional to make an effort to be in this first 12-team Playoff, said Walker Jones, the executive director of The Grove Collective. That started two years ago.It culminated this fall, Jones said, having invested more than $10 million into a roster loaded with talent and highly recruited transfers. Jones said that number likely ranks among the top half of SEC programs.No. 18 Ole Miss goal is still technically in reach, but the 29-26 overtime loss to LSU on Oct. 12 sharply steepened the odds. Among the remaining opponents this season is No. 2 Georgia. The Rebels host Oklahoma this Saturday.Name, image and likeness, with the NCAA forced by the courts to allow athletes to monetize it in 2021, quickly became the most important fuel for roster building in college sports endless arms race. Third-party collectives affiliated with schools became responsible for facilitating it, and Ole Miss was among the schools at the forefront of using the transfer portal to its advantage.GO DEEPER College football portal confidential: How tampering, NIL deals and portal chaos happenNow, even as the way of doing business is changing again amid the House v. NCAA settlement, and with Ole Miss saddled with two losses, it would be easy to decry the roster as money wasted, to point to a program that fell short of its goals.Jones has the same response to that sentiment he gave to countless donors during two years spent frantically fundraising.I dont know if were going to get to the Playoff, he said, days before the loss to LSU. But I know how were not gonna get there. Were not gonna get there if we dont invest in a plan and commit to it.Jones was a former Ole Miss team captain and linebacker from 1994 to 1997 who later worked as the director of sports marketing for Under Armour and became an agent. He founded his own business before agreeing to lead Ole Miss NIL collective in the middle of 2022.To educate the fan base and put a face on Ole Miss approach to NIL, he convinced athletic director Keith Carter to hold a news conference alongside him and Rebels coaches that fall. Despite alerting the SEC beforehand, that aggressive approach earned Carter a cautionary call from the conference afterward.AdvertisementOle Miss, Carter said, is intentional about being aggressive as a means of making up ground between it and competition with bigger budgets and that has had more success traditionally.The NIL world and compliance, its a lot about risk management now. How far do you think you should go? Can you go? Weve walked that tightrope pretty well. Weve been aggressive, Carter said. And weve done well with some of those calculated risks. And the playing field is leveled some with the new model.Jones built relationships with big-money donors and built a subscription platform for fans who could pledge only tens or hundreds of dollars a month.On the field, Dart was showing promise as a sophomore first-year starter. The winds of change were blowing heavily toward an expanded Playoff, making Ole Miss dreams of inclusion more within reach. That December, the 12-team Playoff to launch in 2024 became official.We made a decision with coach Kiffin and others that said, Hey, if were gonna get in that 12-team Playoff, we need to start now, Jones said. I stop short of saying all-in, Playoff-or-bust narrative. But it was an intentional and deliberate approach to put a team together this year to be one of those 12.Roster building means managing three worlds: high school recruiting, roster retention and, yes, the portal. The collective must work closely with the coaching staff.Kiffin quickly agreed to stay mostly uninvolved with how much players were making, Jones said, and The Grove Collective leaves coaches out of financial decisions and negotiations with players. Like most of the more well-funded collectives, The Grove Collective has its own system of metrics and analytics it uses to find valuations for individual players, based on their positions and the teams needs.In 2023, Ole Miss signed 23 prospects to land the nations No. 2 transfer class, according to 247Sports, building on what Ole Miss had already started when it also landed the No. 2 class in 2022. Only four teams signed more transfers, and Louisiana Tech transfer Tre Harris highlighted the class. Harris leads the nation in receiving and had a highlight touchdown catch in the loss to LSU before being sidelined by an injury.AdvertisementIn 2024, the Rebels added 25 more transfers to sign the nations top portal class, with Kiffin embracing his status as the sports Portal King. Five-star defensive lineman Walter Nolen came from Texas A&M to highlight the class alongside Florida edge rusher transfer Princely Umanmielen, Alabama corner transfer Trey Amos and South Carolina receiver transfer Antwane Wells Jr.In the first year, the collective, Jones said, spent far less on roster retention than in the next year. Key contributors wanted to be paid more for their efforts.The speed-dating aspect of recruiting the portal meant enlisting team leaders like Dart, Harris and 325-pound, two-way player JJ Pegues to vet players and sign off on the dynamics of bringing transfer players into the program after they visited campus.The market is settling, Jones said, but any good collective has to be nimble entering each new portal window as players, agents and collectives learn more about how to operate. And the portal works both ways.Star running back Quinshon Judkins announced in January he was leaving Ole Miss for Ohio State after rushing for more than 2,700 yards and 31 touchdowns the previous two seasons. Ohio State athletic director Ross Bjork told ESPN earlier this offseason the Buckeyes had $20 million to spend on their 2024 football roster.Jones and The Grove Collectives efforts in two short years have made waves. Kiffin said in a news conference earlier this year that former Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze had attempted to pull Jones from his alma mater to help Auburn operate its collective. Jones said he got a chuckle out of it.In September, Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek called out Arkansas fans at an event and said they needed to grow their numbers to be more like Ole Miss collective.AdvertisementNobody loves that Ole Miss is in the top five, right? No. We hate it, Yurachek told cameras and a crowd gathered at an event for program supporters.The Grove Collective boasts 6,000 paid subscribers, Jones said, a large portion of whom had never given to Ole Miss before the NIL era and are under 35.But the shocking home loss to Kentucky and the crushing defeat in Death Valley have caused the wheels underneath the fast start to wobble. What now?This isnt a one-shot wonder. Were going to continually build rosters that are relevant nationally and in the top 12 and trying to get into the Playoff every year, Carter said. If we dont get in the Playoff this year, it isnt over. Were just getting started.What that looks like in the future is still unfolding. The House v. NCAA settlement, granted preliminary approval earlier this month, could bring new rules and guidelines to roster management as soon as the summer of 2025.Some collectives might be brought in-house. Some might partner with schools. Some might stay independent but closely connected to the athletic departments they bolster. Each school will have to decide which model fits it best. The NCAA is looking to monitor true market value with a clearinghouse that would vet all NIL deals worth more than $600.Revenue sharing, a major result of the settlement, with schools paying players directly, is expected to be set at a little more than $20 million next year and will rise as television deals grow more valuable.The limited information we have is there will be two buckets of money: the revenue sharing thats mandated from the settlement and incremental, third-party, market-based NIL, Jones said. The second bucket, NIL, will be much harder to police and value, and there isnt going to be a cap to it. One school might say, Were gonna spend another $30 million on top of that rev share. Another school might say, Well, we only have $5 million we can spend.Jones and The Grove Collective want to make sure Ole Miss is closer to the first group than the second.(Photo of Ole Miss players Jamarious Brown, left, and Walter Nolen: Jonathan Bachman / Getty Images)",

            "text": "Let me apologize in advance for cheating a bit.We use the term breakout like its just spontaneous combustion, but thats rarely how it happens. Like most reactions, usually they require a catalyst. Thus, the inherent issue about calling a breakout in advance is that often the term isnt quite what were describing. Instead, the real breakout is one of opportunity, in the form of minutes and touches, rather than one of rapidly changing levels of play.AdvertisementFor example, check out last seasons Most Improved Player award winner, the Philadelphia 76ers Tyrese Maxey. Yes, he has made steady progress since his rookie year in 2020. But the big change for him last season wasnt about his own game; it was about the departure of James Harden days into the season. That transaction opened the door for Maxey to become Phillys primary on-ball initiator, increase his usage rate from 24.1 percent to 28.0 percent and up his scoring rate from 20.3 per game to 25.9.Youll find similar storylines littering the field when looking at my All-Breakout squad for this season, consisting of 11 players I think have a chance to significantly boost their production from a year ago.The Basketball 100 The story of the greatest players in NBA history. In 100 riveting profiles, top basketball writers justify their selections and uncover the history of the NBA in the process. The story of the greatest plays in NBA history. Pre-orderSo, back to the cheating  Ill also note that I cheated a second time since I already have 1/82 of the answers to the test. Its a little easier to come up with an All-Breakout Team when you already have a peek at how minutes and touches will work for most of these teams after a few days of games.That said, projecting breakouts can be a bit harder than it looks. Injuries, slumps and our misperceptions caused by our tiny human brains can easily send a potential breakout sideways. Take a gander at last seasons list, for instance.I had the Most Improved Player (Maxey), but none of the other 13 players who received votes made my list. I had Anthony Edwards, Chet Holmgren and Scottie Barnes on my team, all of whom genuinely broke out  but I also had LaMelo Ball and Mikal Bridges. And then theres Charlottes Mark Williams, who seemed like an easy call 12 months ago. He ended up playing 19 games.With that said, let me bravely charge ahead into my list for this year. I tried to represent every level of the playing spectrum, so along with a few players who are already big stars, I have some deep cuts in secondary roles.AdvertisementMy 11-man All-Breakout Team for 2024-25:This isnt just me riding the wave of Davis dominant opening night performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Hes low-key been on a heater for the last few months; Davis was one of the most productive players in preseason, even when most veterans throttle down to coasting speed, and was one of the best players on Team USAs gold-medal winning squad.Before that, he finished his 2023-24 regular season strong and was fantastic in the Lakers five-game, first-round defeat against the Denver Nuggets, averaging 27.8 points on 67 percent shooting and a playoff-leading 15.6 boards. Hes also, thankfully, playing full-time as a center, which is his most productive position even if he doesnt like it.Health and shooting will always be the swing variables for Davis, but hes off to a good start on those fronts as well  he even made an above-the-break 3 in the opener. The bar is high for a breakout here, but with 39-year-old LeBron James volume possibly on the downslope and few others capable of soaking up the extra chances, this could be a career year for Davis.GO DEEPER Anthony Davis gives Lakers an early dose of hope  and a long-awaited blueprintDyson Daniels, SG, AtlantaThis one isnt the usual case of a player breaking out because of an increase in touches and shots. This is a defensive breakout, where Daniels is being thrust into a role as the Hawks defensive stopper. He was a force at that end in New Orleans, but his role fluctuated because of a crowded backcourt and his iffy shooting, limiting him to 22 minutes per game across 61 appearances and just 17 total minutes in the playoffs.That wont be the case in Atlanta, where the Hawks have been desperate for an elite defender on the perimeter. The 6-foot-8, 21-year-old Daniels is starting and likely will see big minutes as along as his offense is at least somewhat threatening. If so, he has a great chance to lead the league in steals (he had five on opening night and was second in the NBA in steal rate a year ago) and a decent shot at cracking one of the All-Defensive teams.Zion Williamson, PF/C, New OrleansThis one is a pure eye-test call: Williamson finished last season playing the best basketball of his career. He was in the midst of destroying the Lakers in a Play-In game when his hamstring betrayed him. All that seems to have carried over to this year, where he looks fantastic in preseason  statistically, sure, but even more so physically, exploding past people as he did as a rookie and accumulating heaps of layups.AdvertisementAll of this is juiced by his expected positional move to center. Even if it isnt full-time, he should have enough reps at that spot that he can feast blowing past overmatched centers or compromising defenses as a rim-running screener if they try to match up smaller against him.Williamson missed the Pelicans opener with an illness, but that should be a quick absence. I dont know exactly how many games well see of this version of him, but Im excited about the possibility of seeing a full-ish season of peak Williamson. This feels like the season we might get it.GO DEEPER What's behind Zion Williamson's newfound drive? TrustAmen Thompson, positionless, HoustonBetween Wembymania and Thompsons early-season injury, the hype machine for the fourth pick in the 2023 draft never really got rolling. I think that might change this year, when Thompson has a greater chance to establish himself as a hybrid center-guard-not-sure-what-to-call-it dynamo who can blow up offenses with his switchy, twitchy athleticism and wreak havoc in transition at the other end.There are some barriers, as we saw on opening night. Thompson is coming off the bench, and his lack of shooting is exacerbated by a roster that already doesnt have much reliable spacing. He still has to become a more refined decision-maker to take advantage of his ballhandling and athleticism too. That said, Thompsons fine rookie season (18.2 PER, 57.6 percent true shooting, mammoth rebound and steal + block rates) largely went under the radar a season ago, and that doesnt figure to be the case this season on a Houston squad that should be a League Pass favorite.Josh Giddey, PG/SF, ChicagoGiddy only had a lukewarm opener against New Orleans feisty wing defenders, but Ill stay on the bandwagon here. He should fit in his role in Chicago much more easily than he did in Oklahoma City as an on-ball creator with limited shooting gravity. That should provide him more opportunity to grow in some of the other areas (drawing fouls, defense, catch-and-shoots, etc.), where his limitations dragged him down with the Thunder. Additionally, Chicagos situation should give Giddey a lot more opportunities to play through mistakes and develop on the floor.Not that hes chopped liver now. The 22-year-old is a plus passer and rebounder with an excellent floater game and good court vision, and for what its worth, hes also one of the best inbound passers in basketball. That hes also playing for a contract after he and the Bulls didnt reach an extension this past week is another reason to believe in him taking a big step up.GO DEEPER Why teams held the line at the extension deadline, and which clubs made out bestJalen Williams, SF, Oklahoma CityJust because its obvious doesnt mean it isnt true. The Thunder badly need a secondary shot creator to step up, especially with the aforementioned Giddey gone, and Williams is the clear candidate to soak up a lot of those touches and shots.Hes also shown the capability of being a player who can handle that added responsibility efficiently, as hes proven up to the challenge at each step of his development in his first two seasons with the Thunder. Again, its not just about the opportunity here, but about Williams having the talent to sustain a greater role on a winning team. For what its worth, Williams was awesome in his four preseason games, with a 30.1 PER on 66.3 percent true shooting.AdvertisementRJ Barrett, SF, TorontoIf a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears, it, does it makes a sound? What if, instead of a forest, its Canada?Barrett was already showing signs of turning a corner last season in New York, then played significantly better after the trade in Toronto. Nobody noticed because it happened in the general destitution of the Raptors 2023-24 season, but Barrett is becoming a dude.In 32 games as a Raptor, Barrett averaged 21.4 points per game and shot 60.5 percent on 2s. The eye test backed it up; there was more comfort and control in the finishing, more nuanced shot selection and distribution and even (gasp) the occasional right-handed attack.He built on that in the summer by arguably being Canadas second-best Olympian, averaging 19.8 points on blistering 70.1 percent true shooting. While we didnt see him in preseason due to a sprained AC joint, hes listed as day-to-day and expected to rejoin the action soon, so it shouldnt slow him down too much.Entering his age-24 season, on a roster with basically four real players and some serious question marks, Barrett should have plenty of room to explore his limits and continue refining his hard-charging downhill game.Tre Mann makes a move against Miles McBride and the Knicks. (John Jones / USA Today Network via Imagn Images)Tre Mann, SG, CharlotteMann is single-handedly trying to bring baggy back. Seeing him on the court in his 178-pound frame and size XXXXL jersey and shorts, it looks like one of those in-game promotions where they have kids put on an NBA players uniform then run around and try to score a basket.Mann, however, is pretty good at the latter part. He scored 24 points in Charlottes upset of Houston on opening night, continuing a positive stretch of basketball dating to his trade from the Thunder last spring. Mann was one of the leagues most effective players statistically in preseason, which does have some predictive value, and quietly averaged double figures in 28 games for the Hornets at the end of last season.AdvertisementThis was a bit of a surprise, as he had struggled to gain traction for three years in Oklahoma City, and its possible his lack of size for a two guard and limited playmaking for a point guard restrict him going forward. As with Giddey above, theres also a financial incentive. The Hornets could have extended Mann this past week (hes on the last year of his rookie deal) and instead opted to wait and gather more information.Julian Strawther, SF, DenverIm not even cheating on this one because the Nuggets hadnt played yet when I wrote this. But Strawther seems to be at the right nexus of opportunity and production. He was eighth in the NBA in preseason scoring, and the Nuggets desperately need him to fill a void in the wing rotation created by Kentavious Caldwell-Popes departure. He also has the specific skill set they most crave, as a high-volume 3-point shooter on a team that was last in 3-point rate a year ago.Strawthers rookie season with the Nuggets was mostly spent watching, and his NBA minutes didnt go all that well with an 8.2 PER and 29.7 percent 3-point shooting. However, the 22-year-old from Gonzaga has thrived in other settings  hes had two strong summer leagues in addition to his 2024 preseason  and small-sample shooting variance explains much of his poor stats from 2023-24.Cam Thomas green light, BrooklynIm not sure whether this qualifies as a genuine breakout or just something thats going to be fun as hell to watch. But if were talking about touches and opportunity? Sheesh. Thomas had 36 points on 27 shots opening night in Atlanta, and if you look at the Nets roster, that trend line seems likely to continue. Theres just nobody else on the team who can create shot volume like Thomas, and the volume will only increase if Brooklyn moves Dennis Schrders expiring contract.Thomas has always been a high-volume player, ranking sixth in the league in field goal frequency a year ago. However, the criticism was about quality, not quantity. In the past, there have been too many tough 2-point jumpers and little in the way of playmaking, both of which dragged down his efficiency. Thomas corrected some of that in the opener, getting off 13 3-point attempts and making seven, and interjecting at least a couple of passing reads that let you talk yourself into growth there.After 48 hours, he was third in the NBA in field goal attempts and second in scoring. With few other options on the Nets roster and operating in a contract year, Thomas may stay near the top of both columns all season.This isnt quite on Thomas level, but Powell is in a contract year and looks set to re-establish at least some of his value on a Clippers team that really needs his scoring. Or maybe, as a Cheers fan, I just like to yell out Norm! occasionally.AdvertisementEither way, Powell will be the second option next to James Harden for as long as Kawhi Leonard is out. When Leonard returns, Powell will likely revert to a sixth man role. A 17-point, four-assist opener in Phoenix is a good start for this trend line, and Powell did this while going 1 of 7 from 3 (hes a 39.4 percent career shooter from distance).Powell has the added benefit of no longer having to watch the Russell Westbrook show when he checks in with the Clippers subs. Instead, with Leonard injured and Paul George departed, it mostly will be his show any time Harden is off the floor. While Powell thrives best as a secondary scorer rather than a get-out-of-my-way guy, hell also have significant overlap with Harden where he can thrive off the ball. At age 31, he could end up threatening his career-high scoring average of 19.6 from back in Toronto.Sign up to get The Bounce, the essential NBA newsletter from Zach Harper and The Athletic staff, delivered free to your inbox.(Photo of Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson: Tyler Kaufman / Getty Images)",

            "text": "25 Jump Scares That Still Make Us Jump The floor creaks, the music turns ominous and an uneasy quiet sets in. Then BAM! Its the classic jump scare. This staple of horror movies, when done well, is instantly memorable. With Times film writers, filmmakers and stars weighing in, we ranked the 25 jump scares that still get us every time. WARNINGThis article contains spoilers and may include intense scenes that could be disturbing for some readers.David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker on the Buildup in Seven When a rotting figure gasps for breath, the reaction of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and John C. McGinley was so convincing, it spawned a modern myth: that they werent told the body was an actor, not a prop. As it turns out, the stars did know (sorry, internet!), but the fact that the myth persists is a testament to the potency of the scene. In an email, the director, David Fincher, credited the screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker: Andy wrote it  it was a great idea  so I filmed it. The police pull back a grimy sheet to reveal a decomposing body ... ... Brad Pitts detective isnt so sure what hes seeing ... ... and when John C. McGinleys SWAT leader leans over the body, they all get a shock. But in an interview, Walker insisted it was Fincher and the prosthetics and makeup master, Rob Bottin, who turned his vision into a grisly jump scare, one that shouldnt have worked because it was absolutely expected. It was so much more a build, an exciting and almost clichd action scene that kind of slowly turns, Walker said. Their goal was to take the audiences expectation of the cavalry riding in, then to get a buzz saw to the face.  Maya Salam Stream it hereJennifer Kent on the Soundscape in The Babadook A bedroom door slowing creaking open. The scuffling of what sounds like cockroaches. A gravelly voice uttering the dreaded Babadook, dook, dook. And Amelia, a mother whos mentally unraveling, trembling under a blanket. In The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent, the soundscape is both classic haunted house and modern nightmare. The scene was intended to mimic what anyone would feel lying in bed as footsteps approach. All the sound is sucked out of the moment, Kent said in an interview. Its like we become hyper-aware. I hoped to draw the audience in and have them become her. Kent didnt follow tradition and incorporate most sound in postproduction. What I tend to do is make sure that the sound is in there, enough temporary sound is in there to make sure all this visual stuff works, she explained. So its very important to rhythm. Cutting a film is much closer to music than many people probably realize.  Maya Salam Stream it hereINTERLUDE Dont Underestimate the Power of a Jump Scare By Jason Zinoman After seeing Lon Chaneys monstrous face unmasked in the 1925 silent The Phantom of the Opera, a 9-year-old Robert Bloch peed his pants and became hooked on horror. He also grew up to write the novel Psycho, the source for the movie with a jump scare so effective it transformed, for many, the experience of taking a shower. Jump scares are considered the fart jokes of horror: cheap, easy and lowbrow. But that gives short shrift to a long, potent legacy. Of course, they can be crude, overdone and shoehorned in, but they can also be refined, mysterious and emotionally integrated. And as Chaney demonstrated a century ago, even the simplest ones have a power that should not be underestimated. The stakes are high because success is binary: A jump scare produces a jolt or it doesnt work. That puts a premium on novelty. You cant just place another figure in a rotating mirror and expect shudders. Its been done too many times. To really unsettle, you must subvert expectations, add misdirection, a wilder image, perhaps a disorienting sound cue. More ingenuity goes into certain jump scares than entire movies. Far from simple to pull off, a truly great one is a feat of pure cinema. Jump scares have an advantage online, where context shifts rapidly. They can not only work independently of the movie, but also sometimes find a more popular second life outside it. In recent years, a canon has emerged, picked apart and debated by fans yet inspiring to filmmakers. In a genre more crowded than ever, where every kind of abrupt shift of camera angle, music cue or creepy image seems to have been employed to find a new way to shock, jump scares have become increasingly elaborate. At their best, they are ambitious set pieces, operating like showstoppers in musicals. The director James Wan is a contemporary master of the art, and one of his most bravura examples is from The Conjuring (2013), a haunted house movie in which Lili Taylor is terrorized by a clapping sound in the cellar. Patiently established over several scenes, this ingeniously startling fright involves no special effects or monsters. Theres a bouncing ball, two hands and the oldest scare of all: fear of the dark. The result doesnt just judder nerves. Like the most thrilling art, it rattles you into seeing old things anew while reordering your sense of the possible.",

Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesThat is who Donald Trump is, but that is not who we are.If there is one line to take away from Kamala Harriss Tuesday night speech, not far from the White House, that seems like a good choice. With it, the vice president sought to remind us of the chaos and confusion that cling to the former president like slime on a shoe, while expressing the hope that Americans still have faith in themselves, and in one another, to demand better.That, more than anything, is what Harris was selling in her closing argument to that curious collection of voters still on the fence in this presidential race: A way to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the chaos and the division of Trumpism.As high-stakes speeches go, this one was solidly constructed and solidly delivered. Harris isnt an Obama-level orator, whether were talking Barack or Michelle. She acknowledged that many voters still dont feel that they know her well, and this appearance most likely didnt help much with that. It was loaded with platitudes and with sentimentality that wasnt quite personal enough to be moving or illuminating: Raised in a middle-class family. Instinct to protect the little guy. Always listen to you. Always tell you the truth. Never stop fighting for you. Build consensus. We need to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms? Oof.Once she got rolling, though, Harris did spend some time drawing distinctions between what she would do and what Trump would do, including: On Day 1, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. A little cheesy? Sure. But totally accurate, and the presence of the Oval Office right over her shoulder made it real.She then ran through her plans to help make homeownership more accessible, to fight for an expanded child tax credit, to invest in the caregiving economy  complete with a nice shout out to the struggling sandwich generation. In discussing immigration, she mentioned border security first thing. She vowed to fight for the reproductive rights stripped away by Trumps handpicked Supreme Court justices, and she talked up the need for a strong military.This reads like a down-to-earth, bread-and-butter to-do list  with a little something for everyone, and a little something for everyone to hate. Did she dig into the specifics of any of her proposals? No, she did not. This was neither the time nor the place.Harriss top job was to remind everyone what is at stake in this election. Of course, more than perhaps anything she said, her choice of setting drove that point home: the Ellipse at the south end of Presidents Park, the very place where the Jan. 6 riot took form as Trump whipped his supporters into a frenzy before unleashing them on the Capitol.Say this about the Trump era, it has taught everyone the value of political theater.It doesnt have to be this way, Harris reminded us.In another week, well see if shes right.",

            "text": "Shohei Ohtani has been a superstar in Japan for more than a decade, but one day earlier this year, a Tokyo resident named Tatsuo Shinke noticed something different.Shinke, the CEO of Mint, a leading trading card store, had already watched as Ohtanis soaring popularity had fueled the Japanese collectibles industry, spiked Japanese television ratings for Major League Baseball, and pushed baseball news into every corner and crevice of the countrys vast media ecosystem.AdvertisementYet as Ohtani made history in his first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming the first player in history to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in one season, Shinke observed another data point: His mother, Emiko.At 73 years old, Emiko had never followed baseball. But because Ohtanis Dodgers games are aired live in the morning in Japan, and because he has become a daily fixture on the countrys popular morning variety shows  the equivalent of Good Morning America or Today  Emiko developed a new morning routine: She wakes up, eats breakfast, and then turns on Ohtani.Elderly people in Japan love Ohtani, Shinke said. Its my mother. And all my mothers friends. Shes retired already, so she has enough time to watch all the games in the morning.In the United States, the World Series between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers is a matchup featuring the countrys two biggest cities and most high-profile franchises. The audience could surpass 20 million viewers per game for the first time since 2016.In Japan, it will likely be even bigger.In seven seasons in the majors, including six for the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani has lorded his talent over Major League Baseball in a manner previously thought impossible. For his trouble, he has captured two Most Valuable Player awards while dominating as a hitter and a pitcher. If he wins his third this November, as is expected, he will become the first full-time designated hitter to win the award, a role he was forced to play after injuring his elbow last season.At World Series Media Day on Thursday, no one was a bigger draw than Ohtani. (Katharine Lotze / Getty Images)In America, his performance earned him a $700 million contract  the largest in history  and stardom in a sport that increasingly trails its rivals in cultural capital. But back home in Japan, where baseball is the most popular sport, Ohtanis celebrity has reached stratospheric levels, akin to Michael Jordan or David Beckham, figures who transcended their field of play and whose fame turned them into international avatars for their home country.AdvertisementThere isnt a person in Japan who doesnt know who Ohtani is, I dont think, said Robert Whiting, an American author in Tokyo who has written about Japanese baseball since the 1970s.When the Dodgers defeated the Padres in Game 5 of the National League Division Series  a game that featured two Japanese starting pitchers  an estimated audience of 12.9 million Japanese viewers tuned in at 9 a.m. on a Saturday, at least 5.4 million more than watched in the U.S. When Ohtani chased 50-50 in September, his exploits often led the national nightly news and daytime wide shows, spaces that rarely mention sports. (The business newspaper Nikkei also ran a front-page story above the fold.) And when Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, spoke of Ohtani during a press conference in Tokyo earlier this season, he told reporters he wanted to speak not as an ambassador but as a kid from Chicago who watched Jordan rule the 1990s and transcend basketball.This is early on in Ohtani-sans career, Emanuel said, but theres no doubt that thats what he has right now.The sheer volume of wall-to-wall coverage has even surprised Whiting, who first moved to Tokyo in the 1960s and has authored books on baseball and Japanese culture. Japan has seen this story before, the obsession over conquering baseball heroes in the form of Hideo Nomo, Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui, who was World Series MVP for the Yankees in 2009. But perhaps not since Nomo in the 1990s, Whiting says, has a Japanese player embodied and lifted the national spirit.When Nomo debuted for the Dodgers in 1995  in the middle of a nasty trade dispute between the United States and Japan  Whiting recalled that Asahi Shimbun, one of the nations biggest newspapers, ran an editorial stating: In Hideo Nomo, the Japanese have produced a product that no one is complaining about. But whereas Nomo, Suzuki and later pitchers like Yu Darvish validated the quality of Japanese baseball, Ohtani has changed the equation: For the first time, Japanese fans can credibly argue that the most talented baseball player of all time is from Japan.AdvertisementIn the global market, Japanese value and power is (becoming) a little bit weaker, year by year, said Tomoki Negishi, a baseball marketing executive who worked for Japans Pacific League. So Ohtani-sans great performance is a beacon.To some, he says, Ohtani is a symbol of Japan in the global market.To others?He is just a crazy superhero that Ive never seen before, Negishi says.On the morning of October 12, the symbol beamed through a television into a living room in ta, a special ward in Tokyo. Masanori Ninomiya, an owner of an English reading company, finished a traditional breakfast of white rice, miso soup and fruit and then turned on the Dodgers and Padres.Ninomiya, 59, grew up in the city of Oita, obsessing over books about Japanese baseball history. He attended business school at UCLA in the 90s, as Nomo was breaking through. He is among those in Tokyo who work remotely, which allows him to put the Dodgers on in the background during the work week.Everybody will have a breakfast, he said And then its Ohtani.In Japan, all Dodgers games appear on NHK, the countrys free, over-the-air public broadcaster. The audience for NHK often skews older, especially in the mornings. Unlike the United States, where European soccer fans huddle in bars and pubs in the morning, there is less public consumption of Ohtani, outside of major events like the World Baseball Classic. According to Negishi, this is partly due to cultural norms and partly because of the sheer volume of baseball games.Im sure Im not the only one, said Chen Liang, director of imports at Mint cards and collectibles. But theres a huge percentage of Japanese people who are at work, and theyre in front of their computer, and theyre just clicking on the box score while they look at Excel sheets and things like that.AdvertisementNinomiya was awed by Ohtani when he emerged as a two-way player for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. He followed him when he debuted with the Angels in 2018, when the morning ritual began. But he ascribes the national love affair to the way Ohtani has conducted himself on the MLB stage.For example, if theres garbage on the ground, he tries to pick it up, Ninomiya said. We know hes a superstar  and super rich  but he doesnt behave like that.Ohtani and his representatives have cultivated an image in Japan of a modest, polite baseball star who is deferential to teammates and respectful to elders. The reputation helped Ohtani weather a wave of public scrutiny earlier this year, when his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was charged with stealing more than $16 million from an Ohtani bank account to cover gambling debts. (Mizuhara later pleaded guilty.) Its also helped him land a raft of endorsements from companies on both sides of the Pacific and turn his personal life into daily fodder on television. (His wife, Mamiko Tanaka, and his dog, translated to Dekopin in Japanese, are regular characters on the daytime shows.)The comings and goings of Mamiko Tanaka and Ohtani are regular fodder for Japanese morning shows. (Stringer / Getty Images)Those are traits that I think Japanese fans love to see in practice on a foreign land, said Hiroshi Kitamura, an associate professor of history at William & Mary who specializes in U.S.-East Asian relations. Japanese fans love to see MLB players like (Aaron) Judge, (Fernando) Tatis, (Ronald) Acuna say great things about Ohtani as being the unicorn. But I think they also appreciate seeing Ohtani kind of being Japanese. In that sense, I think Japanese fans see Ohtani as part of them.The face of Major League Baseball greeted Foster Griffin each day when he arrived in Tokyo. The billboards. The cardboard likenesses in convenience stores. Ohtanis voice even features in advertisements on the subway.Soon after Griffin, a former Kansas City Royals pitcher, moved to Japan to pitch for the Yomiuri Giants, he learned the cultural primacy of televised nightly news.And he has his own section of the news, Griffin said. They highlight everything he does every day over there. Hes everywhere.AdvertisementFrom an American perspective, its hard to conceive of the popularity of Ohtani in Japan. America does not revere any foreign sports in which they are not supreme. The Japanese media, a sprawling apparatus with five commercial television networks and five national daily newspapers, can be impenetrable for non-Japanese speakers. And contrary to hyperbole, not everyone in Japan cares about baseball.Culturally, I felt like in recent years, the interest of young kids seemed headed to new sports like soccer, said Ema Ryan Yamazaki, a Japanese filmmaker raised in Osaka.The sport, however, remains a cultural unifier, a source of connection at the office or during the morning commute. And Ohtani has transcended demographics, spawning new generations of fans while appealing to retired grandmothers in Tokyo, Fukuoka and Sapporo.In Japan, Ohtani is the face of countless advertising campaigns. (Tomohiro Ohsumi / Getty Images)The school teacher understands a balk and an intentional walk, throughout the entire country, said Bobby Valentine, the former Mets manager who had two stints in Japan as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines. Its like a port of passage. Baseball allows you to be acceptable in the culture. Its just one of those things.When Ohtani led the country to a World Baseball Classic championship last year, more than 42 percent of Japanese households watched Japan defeat the United States at 8 a.m on a Wednesday. Six of Japans seven WBC games drew more than 30 million viewers. Ohtanis presence  along with starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto  could help the Japanese World Series audience approach those heights. The numbers are already so striking that MLB continues to target the Japanese market, and will open the 2025 season with the Dodgers facing the Chicago Cubs in Tokyo, a year after the Dodgers opened the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres. Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Athletic this week that If youre going to open (the season) in Tokyo, the only choice was to take the Dodgers again. And the reason its the only choice is the audiences that those games deliver are so big that it drives whats a real broadcast business for us in Japan.The first pitch of the World Series will come at 9:08 a.m. on Saturday, airing on both NHK and commercial network Fuji TV. Interest is so high that creators of the wildly popular manga show One Piece pushed back a season premiere, to not compete with Ohtani.Smart move to move the show on their part, Yamazaki said. I would, too.AdvertisementAs Ninomaya puts it, the only figure in Japan who could conceivably surpass Ohtani in name recognition is the prime minister, and the current one, Shigeru Ishiba, just took office earlier this month.Some young people may not know our prime minister, he said. But even kids  junior high school students, senior high school students  everybody knows Ohtani.Yes, every generation in Japan is ready for breakfast with Ohtani. Even if there is one that appears most charmed.Earlier this year, Whiting, 82, was talking to his wife, Machiko Kondo, who worked for years as a resettlement officer at the United Nations. For decades, Kondo never expressed any interest in baseball, even as Whiting wrote best-selling books about Japanese baseball history and the meaning of Ichiro, even as he followed games on both sides of the Pacific.But then came Ohtani.Ive written all these baseball books that have gotten national attention, and it doesnt mean anything to her, Whiting said. But now with Ohtani, shes started asking: Did Ohtani have any home runs?The Athletics Andy McCullough and Sam Blum contributed to this story(Illustration: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; Photos: Jayne Kamin-Oncea / Getty Photos)",

Hes already awake, driving through the predawn darkness, pulling into an empty parking lot at 21300 Coach Gibbs Dr. The routine he started his final year at LSU has become a staple of his rookie season in the NFL.AdvertisementYou always here this early? Adam Peters asked after bumping into Daniels in the hallway around 5:30 a.m. a few weeks ago. Peters, the Commanders first-year general manager, was headed to the weight room. Daniels was about to watch some film.Usually, its a little earlier, Daniels told him. But I had to make an extra stop today.Peters looked down. Daniels was holding two boxes of donuts, gifts for his offensive linemen.For a while, his teammates didnt know he was showing up so early; Daniels studies with the door shut and doesnt tell anyone hes there. But in time, the car that kept beating them to the building, day after day, week after week, started to tell them something. A few started to wonder: is it normal for a quarterback to show up this early?Not normal for most, says linebacker Bobby Wagner, a 13-year veteran bound for the Hall of Fame. Normal for the great ones.After Washington took Daniels second in Aprils draft, the teams new center, Tyler Biadasz, figured hed start coming in early to work with the rookie on exchanges. He showed up at 6 one morning and realized he was late. Daniels was already on the practice field, repping that days walkthrough. Alone.GO DEEPER Jayden Daniels' growth with VR simulation has Commanders embracing mind gamesTerry McLaurin knew after his first practice. Daniels hadnt been on the field 15 minutes  hadnt been in the building a week  and he was already making checks at the line of scrimmage. Then the rookie made a throw that cut through the teeth of the defense, a throw McLaurin remembers in detail five months later.Heres why this play is different, the sixth-year Pro Bowl wideout says. The receivers running a crosser, and most guys wait to release it until he clears the hook defender in the middle of the field. They wait until that window opens up, you know?Jayden threw it before there even was a window. Ive never seen a rookie do that.AdvertisementLinebacker Frankie Luvu was on the field that day. He saw the throw. He knew, too.We gotta get our s right on defense, he told himself, because we got ourselves a quarterback.A quarterback? This team? After churning through 27 starters and 10 coaches during the Dan Snyder era  winning just two playoff games in 24 years  as one of the NFLs proud franchises dissolved into dysfunction?There were league investigations and Congressional hearings. Leaked emails. The name change. The railing collapse. RGIIIs knee. Cover-ups. Lawsuits. And losing. Years and years of losing.Ive seen this place from afar, and there was always this black cloud over it, says Washington tight end Zach Ertz, who spent eight-plus years beating up on the franchise as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles. This was an organization that always had talent, but you were never worried about them long-term.With new leadership, a guy like Jayden, the right group around him  this city has waited for this.Still, this is a scarred franchise and a scarred fan base trying to shake that lingering fear thats been beaten into them for 30 years.Paul Walker is 65. Hes wearing a burgundy Sonny Jurgensen No. 9, tailgating ahead of the Commanders Week 7 meeting with the Panthers. My first game in person since the Monday Night Massacre, he says, referring to the night 14 years ago when Eagles quarterback Michael Vick torched Washington for six touchdowns in a 59-28 win. We always got that mentality that somethings eventually gonna go wrong. It just always has.But Im telling you, this season is bringing me back to the Joe Gibbs years. Our quarterback might be the best one weve had since Walker pauses, then points to his chest, to Jurgensens No. 9.Rob Abelman fell in love with football during the Gibbs years. He used to tag along with his dad to games at RFK Stadium, and he watched two Super Bowl wins in person. Then he got so fed up with the team during Snyders run that he canceled his season tickets.AdvertisementThe minute he read Snyder was selling the team, he signed up for new ones. I have the belief because Ive seen it, says Abelman, who with his son, Jared, drives in from Philadelphia for games. (Jared) doesnt. Hes 24. All hes known his whole life is heartbreak.Sunday spoke to both. A 40-7 romp over Carolina  the NFC East-leading Commanders fifth win in six weeks  was tinged by Daniels first-quarter exit. Its a rib injury, not expected to be anything serious, but a reminder nonetheless for a fan base trying to convince itself its allowed to believe again.Hope remains a dangerous thing in the District.It started with an arena league quarterback drilling his dropbacks on an empty field just west of the San Bernardino Mountains. Ryan Porter was mid-sweat when Jay Daniels walked out of the YMCA across the street, recognized him, and asked if hed ever considered coaching. Porter shook his head.But I guess I could, he finally said.Cool, well be here tomorrow, Jay told him. I have a son who plays quarterback.By that point, Jay had pushed his 12-year-old to think about a different position. Jayden was long and lean, always the fastest kid on the field. What about wide receiver? dad would ask. Or cornerback? Jay had played the latter in college, first at Washington, then Iowa State, and to him it was merely a numbers game. Way more opportunities to get on the field, hed argue.The conversation kept coming up. The two kept going back and forth.Dad, Jayden always shot back, Im a quarterback.He was hell-bent, his father says now.So it was settled. Jay wouldnt fight his sons ambitions; hed nurture them.The first thing he did was warn Jayden. Youre gonna have to live in chaos, dad said. If you can live in chaos, then you can do this. Theyd spend hours on YouTube, poring through old games, studying some of the best to ever play the position. Jay wanted his son watching Joe Montana, because Joe Montana never lost his cool. Look at his face, hed tell Jayden. His expression never changes.AdvertisementA hard lesson came early, and it stuck: Jayden was 7, playing defense in the Pop Warner championship, and he was beat around the edge for a touchdown. He looked up at his father, about to burst into tears. Dont cry, Jay pleaded. Its just one play.He knew if the teams best player lost it, everyone else would, too. The tears spilled out. The whole team followed. The game was never close after that, Jay says.That afternoon  and what it taught Jayden  has stayed with him ever since. He built an unflappability into his game, refusing to get rattled. He knows teammates are watching, and teammates will follow.Seven games into his career, Jayden Daniels leads the NFL in completion percentage (75.6) and ranks sixth in passer rating (107.0). (Patrick Smith / Getty Images)Jay had always been a football junkie; his son became one too. Theyd watch college games on Saturdays and the NFL on Sundays. Theyd watch day after day of the scouting combine, then the entire NFL Draft. Porter, who would work with Jayden through high school, learned something early on: this wasnt just a hobby, and it wasnt just a sport.I call it an unhealthy obsession, the coach says. Not one time did Jayden ask, Hey, are my two hours up? He was there to get better. He was never bored. He was just in love with this thing called quarterback.Jay would send over videos from Jaydens U-14 games. OK, we got the zone read and RPO bubble down, hed write. Whats next? Porter realized he could teach Jayden a drill and never have to repeat himself. Hed see a nod, hear Mmmhmmm and nothing more.During workouts, Porter worked the feet more than he worked the arm. The smooth dropbacks Jayden employs now in burgundy and gold  the big five, rhythm five, flash give, seven step, one-step bounce  were first honed on that empty field across from the San Bernardino YMCA. Jayden saw progress through thousands of reps.Your eyes control your feet, and your feet control your arm, Porter kept telling him. He never once tinkered with Jaydens mechanics. He saw no need. Its like a slingshot, Porter says. Throwing a football for somebody like Jayden Daniels is a very natural thing. The minute I make it unnatural, Ive failed him as a coach.AdvertisementJaydens talents blossomed at Cajon High in San Bernardino, where his parents had to sign a waiver to allow him to play varsity as a freshman. He was maybe 130 pounds, Jay says. The Cowboys were state champs three years later. From there the spotlight began to swell, just as Jay had warned, and Jayden wrestled with the rigors of being a star quarterback. The pressure mounted his senior year: Everyone wanted five touchdowns a game, another state title, and, most of all, his college decision.Jay saw it on his sons face at halftime of Cajons playoff opener that fall. Jayden was playing lousy. He looked overwhelmed. Walking into the locker room, coaches kept pulling him aside, pointing out mistakes. The weight of it all, the hype, the expectations  he was a 17-year-old kid shouldering too much.Say something to him, Jay told Porter, who by that point was an assistant at Cajon.So while Jayden warmed up before the third quarter, Porter pulled out his phone and showed him a picture. In it, Jayden was 12 years old, smiling ear to ear, doing his favorite thing in the world: playing football. Forget all this BS right now, Porter told him. I just need you to be this kid.While Jayden stared at the photo, a tear trickled down his cheek. He threw three touchdowns after halftime. Cajon won 39-7 and made its way back to the state title game.While he weighed where to transfer after three years at Arizona State, Jayden Daniels told his dad, If I cant make it at LSU, then I dont deserve to be in the NFL one day. (Scott Winters / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Three years later, another decision beckoned: after a sterling start at Arizona State, Daniels struggled as a junior, tossing as many interceptions (10) as touchdowns. What few knew at the time: how much heartache hed been forced to bottle up inside.The winter before, in a span of three weeks, he lost two grandparents to COVID-19. His grandfathers passing hit hardest: Jays dad had passed football down to him, and Jay had passed it down to Jayden. Jayden and his grandfather had spoken the night before. I love you, his grandpa told him. Itd be the last thing Jayden ever heard him say.AdvertisementMan, that took a toll on both of us, his father says now. He carried a heavy load that season.Meanwhile, the NCAA was digging into ASUs program for alleged recruiting violations. Herm Edwards, the former NFL coach Daniels had come to Tempe to play for, was on his way out. The quarterback sought a bigger stage to finish his college career and an offense better suited to his strengths. He decided to transfer. His phone started blowing up.Daniels decided he wouldnt demand the starting job at his next stop, and his top choice, LSU, wasnt offering it. Hed arrive as the fourth QB on the depth chart.Jay stepped aside and let his son make the decision.High risk, high reward, Jayden told him. If I cant make it at LSU, then I dont deserve to be in the NFL one day.Youre gonna hate me, Sherman Wilson texted him.It was December 2022. Daniels had decided to return to LSU for his fifth and final college season, and Wilson, the Tigers director of player retention, wanted him to know what the next few months were going to look like.Wilson had been goading the quarterback for weeks while he weighed entering the draft. If you wanna be a fourth-round pick, fine, Wilson wrote at one point. But you have more to do here.Once Daniels decided to stay, Wilson became his corner man, Bundini Brown in his ear. Instead of shouting at him ringside, Wilson texted incessantly. Bible verses. Motivational stories. Barbs to seep under Daniels skin. Wilson knew he hadnt come close to reaching his potential in Baton Rouge.You succeed in September by preparing in January, Wilson wrote.Dont act like you wanna be the best if youre not willing to do what others arent.I hope youre ready, because youre not gonna see your family after spring break.For Daniels, everything changed. Hed think like a pro, study like a pro, work like a pro. The first thing he did was sit down with LSUs coaching staff and tick through a series of questions he wanted answered. Among them: Whats the detailed plan of how were going to win a national championship? And: What do I need to do to turn myself into a first-round pick?AdvertisementThe coaches looked around the room. They already had Daniels next few months mapped out, but for the quarterback to show this type of initiative? They knew what was coming. They knew he was about to take over.He put everything into that offseason, says Joe Sloan, LSUs QB coach at the time.A nutritionist cooked Daniels meals and helped him pack on 15 pounds. He started nightly throwing sessions with his top two receivers, Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr., that would last until 10 p.m. In the mornings, Daniels and Wilson would race to the building for 5 a.m. film sessions. Eventually, the quarterback started showing up so early they had to change the keycodes on the door.By the fall he was the best player in college football.Then, one night in November, his season nearly slipped away. A nasty hit knocked Daniels out of the Tigers road loss to Alabama. Im shaking it off! he shouted at Wilson in the medical tent. I gotta finish this! But the staff wouldnt let him. One play, and one concussion, threatened to upend his pursuit of the Heisman Trophy.He texted Wilson around 4 a.m. Theyll probably give it to him, Daniels wrote, referring to Washington QB Michael Penix Jr., Daniels chief competition for the award.Sounds like youre quitting, Wilson wrote back, tapping into Daniels competitive juices.Im not quitting. Just stating the obvious.If youre gonna pack it in, fine.F that, Daniels wrote.The two were in the film room at 5 a.m. on Monday. This is the week thatll define your career, Wilson told him.Daniels couldnt drive, so Wilson picked him up. Daniels was still in concussion protocol, so Wilson used his own fingerprint to get them in the building. The QB watched film of Floridas defense with sunglasses on, his hoodie pulled tight and the door shut. Nobody knew we were there, Wilson says. Daniels barely practiced that week but cleared protocol in time to start.Turns out, the Heisman race wasnt over. Daniels lit up the Gators for 606 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns in a 53-35 rout. A month later he stood on stage in New York City, trophy in hand.Daniels thought his chance at the Heisman disappeared after he was knocked out of a loss to Alabama late in the season. (Rich Graessle / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)On draft night four months later, Daniels waited one pick to hear his name called. Hed been No. 1 on Washingtons board all along, ahead of Caleb Williams, who went first to the Bears. You put in all the work in the early mornings, the late nights, Peters told him over the phone. I couldnt be more proud to pick you to represent our franchise.AdvertisementThen Peters handed the phone over to Dan Quinn. The coach was more direct: Were gonna kick a lot of ass together.Wilson texted a few days later, wanting Daniels thoughts on his new team.Were going to the playoffs, Daniels wrote back.Wilson shook his head  the kid was nothing if not ambitious. But this wasnt college football. The rookie needed to temper his expectations. Brother, this is the NFL, Wilson wrote. This is different.Daniels wouldnt budge.No, listen to me, he replied. Were going to the playoffs.They meet at 9 a.m. every Saturday, an hour before the rest of the team has to be in the building. Inside the room, its just the quarterbacks and skill position players. The 23-year-old rookie stands at the front, running through the 10 or 12 scripted plays the offense plans to open the game with a day later. Daniels reminds them of the audibles he can check into and the coverage beaters hell be looking for.Weve never had meetings like that here, McLaurin says. Not since Ive been here.Kliff Kingsbury, Washingtons first-year offensive coordinator, designed his system around Daniels dual-threat ability  The way he runs, it takes the soul of your defense, Peters gushed on draft night  without putting too much on the rookies shoulders. A heavy dose of short, timing-based throws are mixed in with a stout run game and the occasional deep shot, a healthy balance the young passer can manage. Seven games in, the Commanders are third in scoring (30.1 points per game) and Daniels leads the league in completion percentage (75.6).Marcus Mariota, Daniels backup, says the discipline of his decision-making is rare for a rookie, especially one drafted this high. There are certain expectations that greet a first-round quarterback the minute he walks through the door, expectations Mariota  the No. 2 pick in 2015  knows well. Too many chase highlight plays, Mariota says, the ones they built their name on in college.AdvertisementSo many times young guys in this league are trying to impress people, he says. They wanna extend plays and live up to their draft spot. Jaydens very much, Ill take what you give me. And if you give me the big one, Ill take that, too.'Sloan, now LSUs offensive coordinator, has followed Daniels rookie season closely. Nothings surprised him. He cant help but laugh when he thinks back to the question he kept getting from NFL evaluators last spring. They all wanted to know if Jayden Daniels was ready to be a pro.Listen, Sloan kept telling them, hes already a pro.(Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images)",

            "text": "Brock Purdy ate one at his locker before the Super Bowl. Andy Reid once offered them to his players as a reward. Before practice, during training camp and in the halftime locker room, they are a favorite of players across the NFL, a touch of childhood wrapped in plastic.A few years ago The Athletic wrote about orange slices, the NFLs secret halftime snack (fun fact: teams are required to provide three dozen sliced oranges for halftime for the visiting team). But in the course of reporting that story, many players said they passed on halftime citrus in favor of something else: Uncrustables, the sealed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches found in the frozen aisle of your local supermarket  and apparently permeating the NFL.AdvertisementAt the end of the 2023 season, The Athletic endeavored to find out just how many Uncrustables the league actually eats. And after convincing team employees that this was in fact a real question and not another scam message, most teams agreed to pony up their data from last year. A handful declined to participate, and a few others said they were PB&J purists who made their own sandwiches.But based on the information collected, its safe to say that NFL teams go through anywhere from 3,600 to 4,300 Uncrustables a week. When you factor in training camps and the teams that did not share their data, NFL teams easily go through at least 80,000 Uncrustables a year.Weekly Uncrustable consumption across the NFL DEN 700 SEA 320 JAX 315 MIA 300 ATL 250 NYG 240 PIT 225 ARI 200 MIN 200 LAC 200 BAL 150 WAS 140 CLE 120 CAR 100 TEN 100 CHI 100 IND 90 LAR 90 KC 80 DAL 75 TB 70 LV 60 CIN 50 NO 50 Note: 24 of 32 NFL teams provided The Athletic with approximate ranges for weekly Uncrustables eaten. The graphic represents the highest amount each team eats in a week. = 10Len Kretchman, a former wide receiver at North Dakota State, lived in the small town of Fergus Falls, Minn., and worked with schools in the food service industry. Sometime in the mid-90s, Len said, his wife, Emily, suggested he create a mass-produced peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the crust.The project appealed to Lens business instinct: a simple idea with a complex logistical problem to solve. The Kretchmans started in their kitchen with a loaf of bread, one jar of peanut butter, one jar of jelly and a few drinks.Were not recreating the atomic bomb here, Len said. Were trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  It was two people standing there, goofing off, probably having a beer and a glass of wine and saying, What do you think of this?'The first decision they made was that the sandwich should be round.The moon is round, the sun is round, the Earth is round, its our favorite shape, Len said. Do you have to go to a committee and survey people on what the shape should be? No. Its round. So we got that nailed down.Secrets behind the NFLs favorite sandwich Kitchen-counter to mass production Founder Len Kretchmans wife, Emily, suggested commercializing the snack, which got its iconic round shape from initially being cut out using a drinking glass. Innovative technique Putting the jelly in the middle and covering it with the peanut butter turned out to be the key to protecting the jelly from leaking. Whats in a name? The original name of the product, The Incredible Uncrustable, was coined by an 11-year-old boy whose father was involved in the business.Next, he grabbed a cup from his kitchen cabinet.If you asked moms how they (took the crust off a sandwich) 30 years ago, theyd say: I found a glass in my cupboard that was the right dimension and I pressed on the bread and I cut the crust off,' Kretchman said. And thats what we did!They added a crimp to the edges of the crustless bread, which was easy, but then had to figure out how to keep the jelly from oozing, which was not. Every time they thawed their creations, the jelly bled into the bread and ruined the sandwich. Much trial and error followed.We finally put the blob of jelly in the middle of the bread and then covered it with peanut butter and encased the jelly so it doesnt leach into the bread, Kretchman said. That was key. That was our gee-whiz moment.Were not recreating the atomic bomb here... were trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Len Kretchman, Co-inventor of UncrustablesKretchman and his business partner, David Geske, pitched their product to local schools. They needed a name. Once again, the idea landed in their kitchen. They asked the 11-year-old son of a business associate for a suggestion. His answer: The Incredible Uncrustable. Four years later, in 1999, Smuckers bought the company, dropped the first part of the name and introduced the country to the Uncrustable.It took a little time, but the NFL wasnt far behind.The Uncrustables eaten by the NFL in one year would cover over 18 yards of a football fieldThey werent there when former Pro Bowl tight end Dallas Clark was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in 2003. Of that much hes certain. But the moment this new treat joined the food ranks with all that other healthy crap the Colts provided? He cant really say.All that he remembers is the feeling that something beautiful had happened.AdvertisementIts up there with the cell phone where youre like, How is this done?' Clark said. When they came out it was like, Duh, why did someone not think of this a looong time ago?'It was Jon Torines job to stock those snacks, healthy crap and all, for the Colts. And it was an especially important job during the week of the Super Bowl in 2007 when the Colts played the Chicago Bears in Miami. In the hotel ballroom where the team stayed, Torine, the Colts strength and conditioning coach at the time, laid out a spread for players to grab and go as they moved from meeting to meeting.You could throw your playbook on top of em, didnt make any difference. Squished, unsquished, youre gonna crush it. Jeff Saturday, former Colts centerWe were all scoopin and scorin, said Jeff Saturday, a center on that team. We were grabbing five, six at a time.Clark, a player who struggled to keep on weight, would throw them in his backpack, unbothered by what would happen to them once there. The Uncrustables always found their way to the bottom and got smashed by the playbook, he said. But still edible. Still in one compartment.Didnt matter, Saturday said. You could throw your playbook on top of em, didnt make any difference. Squished, unsquished, youre gonna crush it.They are now a staple for many NFL teams. San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle eats two on flights to road games and anywhere from two to four on flights home. Chiefs defensive end Mike Danna eats them at the team facility and at home. Ravens kicker Justin Tucker grabs one from the snack table on his way to meetings. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce claimed on his podcast that he eats more of them than anything else in the world.Were all creatures of habit, dude, Saturday said. Almost freakishly. If youre a two-Uncrustables-a-day kind of guy, thats just what you do.Each week, the NFL consumes nearly the weight of three Travis Kelces in UncrustablesTorine and most nutritionists wouldnt recommend frozen, processed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as their No. 1 healthy snack option for players. But Uncrustables can do the job, especially when time is limited, and even nutritionists at the highest level of sports performance make compromises.AdvertisementThe bread and jelly give players quick carbohydrates. The peanut butter provides a little fat and a little protein. Theyre easy to digest, convenient to eat and a comfort food that players love (though there is wide disagreement as to whether grape or strawberry is the better jelly flavor  the correct answer is strawberry).In fact, the Colts also ate Uncrustables at halftime of Super Bowl XLI, when they beat the Bears 29-17.So maybe that was the difference, Torine said, laughing.",

A Democrat, she is running against Representative Thomas Kean Jr., a first-term Republican.Sue Altman has made a name for herself by taking on political heavy hitters in New Jersey.First was Chris Christie, the famously pugnacious Republican governor, who, during a 2016 town hall, was so exasperated by her questions about education funding that he tossed his microphone to her.Three years later, she tangled with George Norcross III, then among the states most influential Democratic power brokers, as she led a drumbeat of criticism against corporate tax breaks awarded to companies with close ties to him.Now Ms. Altman is seeking to unseat Thomas Kean Jr., a first-term Republican congressman who is the scion and namesake of a former governor, in one of a handful of races nationwide that will determine whether Republicans retain control of the House.The result of Tuesdays election in New Jerseys Seventh Congressional District may say a lot about how Mr. Kean, 56, has campaigned in the race, where recent polls have prompted Democrats to mount a last-minute push in hopes of flipping the seat.Image Mr. Kean, a son of a former Republican governor, was elected to the House two years ago. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York TimesBut it also may offer insight into the direction of New Jersey and of suburban swing districts like the Seventh, an affluent and well-educated region split nearly evenly between Republicans and Democrats. President Biden beat Donald J. Trump there by four points in 2020, but two years later Mr. Kean beat the Democratic incumbent, Tom Malinowski, by about three points.Ben Dworkin, director of Rowan Universitys Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship, said he saw the election mainly as a referendum on the hold that Mr. Trump has on the moderate wing of the Republican Party.If Democrats are able to win in NJ-7, Professor Dworkin said, then it will really show the negative impact that Donald Trump had on Republican candidates down ballot.Republican PACs have poured millions of dollars into the race. Voters in some parts of the North Jersey district, which stretches from the states border with Pennsylvania through quaint towns filled with horse farms to the eastern cities of Rahway and Linden, say their mailboxes fill regularly with Kean campaign literature.According to polls, Mr. Kean is ahead by about two points against Ms. Altman, a former teacher and professional basketball player who until last year ran the Working Families alliance, a left-leaning political organizing group.The campaign arm of House Democrats committed to spending about $4 million just last week  its first financial commitment in the race  after surveys showed that the contest was narrowing. Democratic Party luminaries like Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a leader of the congressional progressive PAC, and Bill Bradley, a former U.S. senator and New York Knicks star, have joined Ms. Altman, 42, on the campaign trail.At a candidate forum last week, the races high stakes and the potency of abortion rights as a political issue were on display.Mr. Kean described Ms. Altmans support for abortion access as abortion on demand, the same terminology he used two years ago in his successful campaign against Mr. Malinowski.Ms. Altman supports abortion access and a New Jersey law that codified the right to the procedure throughout a pregnancy.Mr. Kean, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, describes himself as pro-choice and said he would oppose a national ban on abortion. But he has also said that abortion policy was best handled at the state level when asked about the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which ended a constitutional right to abortion.During the forum, Mr. Kean, who opposed funding for Planned Parenthood while in the State Legislature, twice referred to doctors who commit abortion. When asked about the phrasing, which could be interpreted as condemning doctors who perform abortions, he said he had misspoken.Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by 917,000 voters.But that is not the case in the Seventh Congressional District, where the G.O.P. has more support and people who are not registered with either major party represent the largest bloc of voters. The district is filled with fiscally conservative residents who also support moderate social policies and who helped to propel Republicans like Mr. Christie; Mr. Keans father, Gov. Thomas Kean Sr.; and Christine Todd Whitman to the states highest office.A Monmouth University poll that put Mr. Kean ahead by two percentage points also found that more voters trusted him to handle issues related to the economy and crime. That edge was dwarfed, however, by Ms. Altmans advantage when voters were asked about abortion and reproductive health policy.Mr. Kean and his campaign have emphasized the brand of liberal politics that Ms. Altman stood for while leading Working Families, one of the states most progressive organizations. He has also highlighted a comment she made in 2020 on social media that referred to those of us working on #DefundThePolice in Jersey.She has apologized for that sentiment and disavowed it, saying she has since gained a better understanding of policing from officers and family members who worked for police agencies.But it is an issue that has resonated. At a town-hall meeting Ms. Altman held in Phillipsburg, on the states western flank, a member of the audience, Vinny Panico, challenged her position on policing.We have people breaking into houses, rummaging through peoples personal belongings to find their car keys to steal their cars, Mr. Panico, 33, a Republican, said in a subsequent interview, referring to a yearslong uptick in car thefts. Our police departments, and our men and women in blue, and our justice system, need support.Like Mr. Kean, Ms. Altman has worked to appeal to centrist voters, or, as she describes them, moderate people who are witnessing their beloved Republican Party dwindling down to this extremist morass.She grew up in the district, regularly mentions that her parents are Republicans, and in stump speeches stresses her background as an anti-corruption advocate with a record of opposing Democratic as well as Republican leaders.Both candidates are highly educated and each has raised more than $5 million in campaign contributions. Ms. Altman has two masters degrees from Oxford; Mr. Kean has a masters from Tufts and completed his doctoral studies there.But the comparisons end there.Mr. Kean is an awkward public speaker, holds few events open broadly to the public and avoids most media requests for interviews.Ms. Altmans energy and candor are among the first things people note after listening to her speak.To me, shes like a breath of fresh air, Melissa Lipman, 78, a Democrat, said after an event last week.",

            "text": "What does it really mean to live in a country where abortion is no longer a constitutional right? Since 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, many states have made it all but impossible to get abortion care within their borders, and have done their best to isolate people facing unwanted or complicated pregnancies, making them afraid to reach out to medical providers or even to friends and loved ones who might help them. New laws have forced doctors to delay care in life-threatening situations and made women afraid to seek it, leading to preventable deaths. Did anyone really want this?Even when the consequences havent been that dire, the day-to-day reality of abortion in Americas left-behind places now involves navigating constant undercurrents of confusion and fear: Is this pill I found on the internet safe? If I miscarry, is anyone going to help me? Or, in the cases of some doctors: How can I help this patient without getting arrested?We asked people at the front lines of abortion access to help us understand how the new laws have filtered into their worlds. They answered our call with texts, audio messages, videos and pictures; some shared their stories anonymously out of fear of reprisal. Taken as a whole, their dispatches show us an untenable status quo, held together by sheer grit and determination. But for how much longer?This presidential election will be the first since the Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, when voters will be presented with a choice: to try to rein in the chaos unleashed by the ruling or to live in a country that continues to be shaped by it.",

Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Over the next few days at the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris will accept her partys nomination and reintroduce herself to American voters. Today, my colleague, Astead Herndon, looks at the key periods in Harriss life that explain who she is, what she believes, and the kind of president she might become. Its Monday, August 19. Astead, thank you for coming in here.astead herndonThank you for having me. Im happy to be here.michael barbaroThe strange thing about this election  I mean, there are a lot of strange things about this election.astead herndonIm like, one?michael barbaroOne of the strange things about this election is that we have a Democratic nominee who has been the nominee for, what, four weeks? And did not go through the yearlong public dissection that generally occurs when you run for president and makes everybody very familiar with your life story by the time you become the nominee. And we actually keep hearing that when we go out and report about Harris. A lot of people, theyre interested in her, but they dont really know who she is. And thats why we want to talk to you. We want to tell the story of Kamala Harris in as full a way as possible. And you have spent the past couple of years doing that, not knowing that we would arrive at this moment, but just because it was a story that you got really interested in. How do you think about the life story of Kamala Harris?astead herndonYeah. I think there is often an incentive to try to get an easy answer to who is Kamala Harris or what does she believe in. And the thing that I have learned in covering her over this time is that you should resist that desire, that theres not really an easy answer. And the boxes that folks try to put her in, whether it be about identity or about comparison to past politicians, namely Barack Obama, I dont think are really that helpful in terms of understanding someone whose life and track to this point has been really singular.michael barbaroEmbracing that thesis that this is a singular person whos resistant to easy labels, where do you think we should start to try to understand who she really is? Whats the first chapter of this singular story of Kamala Harris?astead herndonI would start in her growing up. She grows up in Oakland in the backdrop of the 1960s Bay Area, and is really shaped by her family and community thats around her. Her mother was a scientist at the University of California Berkeley, and an immigrant from India who came here to learn at the school and meets her father, who is also an academic there and is a Jamaican immigrant. And importantly, theyre activists who were, like many people in that time, active in the Civil Rights Movement. And she tells stories when shes on the trail about going to marches and rallies from times of being in a stroller. I would also say that the multiculturalness and specifically the racial identity of the place she grows up really matters. This is someone who is growing up really around not only just a Black community, but a very prideful, rich history of Blackness.michael barbaroExplain that.astead herndonThe Black Panthers headquarters was blocks from her house. And her parents did a very intentional effort to place their children in Black affirmation spaces. They would go to these classes on the weekends where kids from the community would come and have these Black history lessons. It was called The Cactus Club. And the reason it was called The Cactus Club is because it was about Black people being able to grow in any environment.michael barbaroJust like a cactus.astead herndonYeah. And that lives alongside her also having a really comfortable relationship with the Indian side of her family. I mean, she would travel to India. Her parents family were folks who were fighting for democracy and their independence movements. She would have those conversations with her grandfather. I mean, so it wasnt someone who I think was really only defined by one thing. But it was very much taught from an early age that you exist, Im using a coconut reference, but you exist in the context of both of those things. And so that was very much an intentional effort from her mother. And by the time shes in elementary school, she finds herself as a part of a group of students who are involved in a desegregation program that buses them to a different part of town. Theyre actually the second class of Black Berkeley to be shipped.michael barbaroBig deal.astead herndonYeah. And its something that really shapes her growing up. I talked to one of her friends from growing up. Her name is Cynthia Bagby, who mentioned remembering when her and Kamala Harris, first grade, were at the bus stop being ready to be bused to a different part of town. And Cynthia told me this story about how nervous she was, about how she didnt have white friends and she knew that they were being put in a different situation and environment.michael barbaroTheyre plunged in a completely alien place.astead herndonAbsolutely. But what Cynthia told me was that she remembers a young Kamala Harris being so confident and being so unfazed by this situation that when they got back from school, she noticed how Kamala had already 10 friends, was kind of socially running the place. Everyone loved her after the first day.michael barbaroThe mayor of the new largely white school.astead herndonYeah. And so those were the type of stories that people would tell that not only was there a confidence that flowed, but there was a comfort with herself and her identity that really attracted people to her.michael barbaroAnd that comfort youre describing seems like it would flow pretty directly from the way her parents raised her, the classes they brought her to, and that this is an extremely self-possessed person who knows her spot in the world.astead herndonAbsolutely. I remember asking her once, where did this come from, youre self-belief? And I remember her saying, I was raised to believe that I belong in every room that I am in. And that is the core of Kamala Harriss self-belief. It does not come from the position she has now. It does not come from status gained later in life. It comes from an instilling of confidence and pride that started from the day she was born. And so by the time that Kamala Harris is in high school, she knows that she wants to go to an HBCU to follow in the footsteps not only of people around her, but of historical figures who she admired, like the Thurgood Marshalls of the world. And I think thats an important choice.michael barbaroWhy?astead herndonBecause youre achieving young people of color, theres sometimes an incentive to follow the White institutional elites to X place, go to an Ivy League, go to this or that. A 15-16-year-old with the world in front of them saying, I want to put myself at Howard University isnt a small choice. It is a recognition of who the communities are that matter to them and their belief that Black folks can shape them to be excellent, period.michael barbaroHow does the next chapter of her life, her chosen career as a prosecutor, how does that flow from everything that youre just describing? All this pride in being a member of the Black community. Because in my, perhaps, naive mind, being in law enforcement in the period when shes coming out of Howard, seems like it might be in conflict with being a proud member of a Black community that American law enforcement is increasingly seen as having a very adversarial relationship with.astead herndonYeah, I think this comes up all the time. And to be clear, it came up when she was growing up. I mean, when I talk to people from Oakland, they say that when young Kamala Harris, theyre shining community star, decided to become a prosecutor, it was a topic of conversation among her family and friends. Like, what you doing, sis?michael barbaroAnd what was her answer?astead herndonShes talked about this a lot in speeches and interviews, and taken people through how she thinks about this decision.archived recording (kamala harris) When it came time to make my career choice, my family gathered around. And they said, Kamala, what are you going to do in your fight for justice? And I got all excited. And I said, Ive decided Im going to be a prosecutor. If you have any sense of who my family is, you will know that at best they found it a curious decision. And with some of them, I had to defend the decision like one would a thesis.astead herndonShe knew she was making a controversial choice.archived recording (kamala harris) I believe safety is a civil right. A civil right to which all people are entitled. And lets talk about a myth, a myth that Black people dont want public safety. That is simply not true.astead herndonAnd part of the reason she gives is that minority communities and specifically Black people deserve safety.archived recording (kamala harris) And I said, why is it that we should only be on the outside of systems? Isnt there a role also for us to play on being on the inside, where the decisions are being made?astead herndonAnd to go back to context, I think its important to recognize this is the 1980s. This is a generation of Black people that are coming after the Civil Rights Movement that have access to institutions and halls of power for the first time. And for a lot of those people, there was a real ethos of, you need to do something with that. You need to wield these instruments of power to be more responsive to Black communities. You could enter those halls and make them things that worked for Black people.michael barbaroWhat does it look like once she gets inside these halls of power, actually becomes a prosecutor? How does she put this philosophy about representation and change into practice?astead herndonShe runs for district attorney in San Francisco. And she, frankly, makes her whole public pitch around this idea that its not empathetic to say, dont lock anybody up. And so thats how she wins that first race. But she also does it, I think, through representing a vision of the future rather than past. Her identity is laced into that argument. The fact that shes young, the fact that shes a person of color, the fact that she is a woman are all things that really matter. It is not about the identity, but that has always been an implicit part of the pitch. She was making an argument that was about the policy.michael barbaroNot about her identity, but her identity obviously came with the package of her as a candidate.astead herndonYes, comes with the package of the candidate and is part of the reason that shes arguing that these institutions can do something different is because I represent something different. And once she wins office, what it looks like for her to put this into practice is a set of policies that I think really add up to the earliest versions of what we now call a Progressive prosecutor. She says that you can be focused on delivering safety and accountability while you also look at root causes or try to be empathetic to people, in a way that separates herself from what, I would describe, as the crime bill, Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, 1990s view of the world.michael barbaroWhats a good example of this?astead herndonOne example I would say is the Back On Track Program that she started. That was one of the first to allow formerly incarcerated felons to find their way back into the workforce. Shes really proud of that. Thats obviously been something thats been taken nationally at this point. I think its just the thing that people agree on should happen.michael barbaroThat there needs to be a bridge between prison and the rest of your life.astead herndonBut that, at the time, was kind of spicy. And thats one of the things that she piloted. The other thing I would say and the thing that blew up is what she was doing around the idea of truancy or the chronic absence of children in schools. One of the things that happened in the time when she was prosecutor was there were some data that came out that showed that people who are incarcerated usually missed a bunch of school in their time of growing up, that early absences in childhood were indicative of someone who might have future criminal justice problems. And so there was a question of what to do about that.archived recording 1 Joining us to explain how truancy impacts the entire family is San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris. It is great to have you with us.astead herndonAnd from a prosecutors vantage point, she actually tried to take this problem on.archived recording (kamala harris) And what weve done is we started an initiative a couple of years ago that involved me assigning prosecutors to go and meet with the teacher when they met with the parent. And so the prosecutors there and the parent says, whos that mean looking person? And they say, thats the prosecutor, because if we cant fix this problem, they may end up prosecuting you. But by the way, the way we want to fix the problem is weve got all these services for you.astead herndonShe used her role to Institute a series of policies that would hold the parents accountable for chronically absent children.archived recording (kamala harris) And its been fantastic, because when the principal would otherwise call the parent and say, Miss Smith, Johnnys not in class. Would you return my call? Call went unanswered. Now, the principal calls and says, Miss Smith, Johnnys not in class. And by the way, that DA Kamala Harris has said she might prosecute you and send you to jail. And that call gets returned.astead herndonBasically, after a series of warnings, charging the parents if their kids miss enough school under the idea of it would make the kids come more frequently and stop them from getting involved in the criminal justice system kind of before it becomes a big problem. And while that could be good in theory, the reality was that this resulted in a targeting of Black, low income, people of color.michael barbaroThe very people that she thinks of herself as trying to improve the lives of.astead herndonAbsolutely. There were a couple of instances, particularly when the program was adopted by other places, that resulted in parents being perp walked, that resulted in charging certain parents. And I think it had the stench of punitive meanness that was already coming down on people who had a lot of problems.michael barbaroWhat do you make of that?astead herndonTo me, its indicative of a worldview that is reflective of a prosecutor. I think if youre a mayor, a city councilor, Senate, or House, youre used to seeing problems from a 360 lens and you get afforded the space to come up with a vision to solve them. Thats not really what prosecutors do.michael barbaroThey charge or they dont.astead herndonThey react. They hold people accountable. Its about law enforcement. And so this example of truancy is one of the times she tries to take that law enforcement view of the world and apply it to root causes of a problem. And so I think you can see it from a lot of different vantage points. And one way, its a Progressive prosecutor thinking about how can I attack a problem at its root. Thats a really kind of progressive thought. But at the same time, what she did with that was kind of punitive. It was not something that really attacked the full scope and then I think had the impact of, frankly, reinforcing some of the same tropes about these parents and these communities that Im pretty sure she wants to avoid. And I think that shows the limits of that kind of accountability viewpoint.michael barbaroOr perhaps even the contradictions of it. But she seems comfortable with those contradictions. That on some level, yes, shes trying to solve a problem at its root, insofar as shes able to do it. And it might actually result in some parents getting in some real trouble, parents in the Black community shes there to try to protect and improve the lives of, but shes kind of made peace with that.astead herndonI think so to a certain extent. For one, on truancy, she does back off. And so I do think that there were academics and Progressives who reached out to that office to say that you are making a mistake. And some of that eventually landed. But I do think that there is a sense of comfort with the idea that harm creates consequences. And some people are going to get locked up.michael barbaroAnd you might not like me for it.astead herndonAnd you might not like me for it, but I think you like the results of it. And I think her view of the world is accountability can be empathetic. And she rides this approach to the attorney generals office and then eventually to the US Senate. And shes comfortable with that approach. Its when she goes to Washington and eventually runs for president when a lot of this becomes uncomfortable.michael barbaroWell be right back. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Astead, take us into the next chapter of this story here. Kamala Harris as a Democratic candidate for president, when this record of hers as a prosecutor, as you just said, becomes less comfortable for her.astead herndonYeah, I think about the 2016 election. On that night, she was all but guaranteed to be the next senator from California.michael barbaroShe wins the US Senate seat the night of the Clinton versus Trump election?astead herndonYes. And there was a sense among Democrats that not only would Hillary Clinton win, but Clinton would be a transition to a next coming of Democratic stars.michael barbaroBut a few years down the road.astead herndonA few years down the road.michael barbaroBut, of course, thats not how that night goes. Donald Trump wins. And very immediately, Democrats are thrust into this mass resistance where they are searching for someone who can become the face of leading the party out of the rubble. And so she goes from being someone who should have six years to start to understand Washington, to someone who is being floated as a possible 2020 presidential candidate. Its a real sea change in the trajectory that she was supposed to have. And as shes having this open discussion about whats happening next, she has a couple viral moments that make her a celebrity. The Supreme Court confirmation hearings.archived recording (kamala harris) Can you think of any laws give government the power to make decisions about the male body? archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Uh.astead herndonI think Kavanaugh really encapsulated a lot of that.archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Im happy to answer a more specific question. archived recording (kamala harris) Male versus female. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) There are medical procedures.astead herndonThe way she was going at Jeff Sessions and Trump figures of the time.archived recording (kamala harris) Sir, I have just a few  archived recording (jeff sessions) Will you let me qualify it? If I dont qualify it, youll accuse me of lying. I need to be correct as best I can. archived recording (kamala harris) I do want you to be honest. archived recording (jeff sessions) Im not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous.astead herndonAnd she becomes a hero for a lot of these folks and a driver of Democratic fundraising. And so it elevates you from someone who people are talking about in the background to being someone who is seen as a star of the party. And that only furthers the question of running for president. And frankly, I think cements it. And so by the time that she is actually putting her hat in the ring, the campaign comes up with a strategy that I think is reflective of the things we were talking about before. They dont want to choose an ideological lane. They want her to be everything to everyone. And they think that they can do that in this race.michael barbaroAnd be true to herself.astead herndonAnd be true to herself.archived recording (kamala harris) Whats up, Oakland? [LAUGHS]astead herndonAnd I remember the announcement speech she gave in Oakland where there was 20,000 people outside.archived recording (kamala harris) It was just a couple of blocks from this very spot, nearly 30 years ago as a young district attorney, I walked into the courtroom for the first time and said the five words that would guide my lifes work, Kamala Harris for the people.astead herndonAnd she told a very clear story about why she became a prosecutor, about what her vision was going forward.archived recording (kamala harris) I knew our criminal justice system was deeply flawed. But I also knew the profound impact law enforcement has on peoples lives and its responsibility to give them safety and dignity. I knew I wanted to protect people. And I knew that the people in our society who are most often targeted by predators are also most often the voiceless and vulnerable. And on that point, I believed then, as I do now, no one should be left to fight alone. [CHEERING]astead herndonAnd I think was really reflective of the vision of what that campaign thought they could do.michael barbaroAnd the story youve been telling here.astead herndonAnd the story weve been telling here. The problem was thats not how that primary went. It wasnt a primary that was really about working with institutions to make marginal gains.michael barbaroIt was about blowing them up to a degree.astead herndonYeah. And over the next several months archived recording 2 Good evening, Senator. Thank you for being here. You position yourself as aligned with the Progressive movement to make criminal justice less punitive and racist. Yet, your record as a prosecutor shows that you embrace the tough-on-crime mentality.astead herndonAs activists are creating litmus tests about what progressive means, about what constitutes criminal justice reform archived recording 3 Will you support the Bernie Sanders bill, which essentially gets rid of insurance? archived recording (kamala harris) I support Medicare for all, but I really do need to clear up what happened on that stage. It was in the context of saying, lets get rid of all the bureaucracy. Lets get all of the ways  archived recording 3 Not the insurance companies? archived recording (kamala harris) No. Thats not what I meant. I know it was astead herndon forcing her to answer more specific questions about what health care systems should look like and things like that.michael barbaroThis is the year where the moderators are always asking the Democratic candidates on the debate stage to raise their hand if they think that private health insurance should go away.astead herndonYeah.archived recording 4 Youve been asked to clarify this question a couple of times over the course of the campaign. Once and for all, do you believe private insurance should be eliminated in this country? archived recording (kamala harris) No. archived recording 4 You dont? archived recording (kamala harris) No, I do not. archived recording 4 But you raised your hand last night. archived recording (kamala harris) The question was, would you give up your private insurance for that option? And I said, yes. archived recording 4 I think you heard it differently than others then. archived recording (kamala harris) Probably, because thats what I heard.astead herndonAnd the primary became more and more about structural change and about how you articulate policy visions. She fell further and further behind, partly because thats not how she functions. And so at the time and when she was supposed to introduce herself to the country, I think the campaign was telling a fairly inconsistent story about who she was personally and who she was ideologically, and people werent really responding to that. And that feeling ends up overtaking the campaign.archived recording 5 We are confirming that Senator Kamala Harris plans to drop out of the 2020 presidential race. archived recording 6 Miss Harris entered the race as a major force on the campaign trail. You recall she had a huge crowd in Oakland. But she failed to capitalize on that early enthusiasm and plummeted in the polls. [UPBEAT MUSIC]michael barbaroThat race and the way youre describing it, Astead, makes me want to understand what happened to that self-confident person who doesnt want to check the boxes and knows who she is, and says, accept me on my own terms. Obviously, one of the answers are the debate stages and the litmus tests you just mentioned. But we all know what happened in that race. The person who won the Democratic primary astead herndonWas the person who flipped all those tests off.michael barbaroAnd the person who sounded the most like Kamala Harris, Joe Biden. Equally associated with moderate politics, law and order, defending the police, and working within the system. She could have done what he did.astead herndonAbsolutely. It wasnt as if those positions were incompatible with the Democratic electorate. But what Joe Biden was willing to do in that primary that Kamala Harris wasnt was tell those Progressive groups to  they flipped them off. He told them, I dont care what your litmus tests are. This is who I am. Youre going to take this experience. And most importantly, Joe Biden was telling a consistent story about electability. I can beat Trump, and thats what you need to focus on. That was not where other people were. And most importantly, Harris was pulled away from what I think that self-confidence was.michael barbaroIt goes back to this idea perhaps that this just happened too fast. She wasnt ready.astead herndonI think so. When youre a journalist asking Bernie, Biden, even Warren, a question, theyve spent so much time thinking about running for president and their worldview, they return to a core belief. They return back to a basic, fundamental understanding they have about why problems are the way that they are. And no matter what question you ask, even if they dont fully know, theyre going to return back to that core. What was missing from Harris, in my opinion of 2020, was that sense of core. And so when she was asked questions on arenas she was uncomfortable in, you could feel her swimming for an answer. And I think that read as inauthentic. And particularly when youre not a figure that people already know. And so in her moment of introducing herself to the country, she was the most distant from the person shes always been. And I think that gap is what doomed that campaign.michael barbaroAnd then, of course, out of the ashes of this pretty abject failure of a campaign comes the vice presidency.astead herndonYeah. And I think its important to remember how she drops out in a way that I think was really sudden for people. And almost immediately, you saw the tide of sympathy turn in the Democratic Party.michael barbaroToward her?astead herndonToward her.michael barbaroFascinating.astead herndonPeople saying, maybe we were too hard on her. And that started immediately. And so by the time Joe Biden becomes someone whos looking for a VP and then, importantly, makes a pledge to choose a woman in that summer, a lot changes between the time that Biden becomes the nominee and the time in which hes selecting a VP. You have not only the onset of the pandemic and the shutdown of the country, but you also have the explosion of the racial justice protests that happened after George Floyds murder. And so the conversation around Bidens VP selection gets wrapped up in both of those facts. And you have a pretty open debate among the party about whether he has to choose a Black woman.michael barbaroNow theres pressure not just to choose a woman, but to choose a Black woman.astead herndonAnd so I think there was a feeling that if you did not choose Kamala Harris, you were skipping over the most qualified Black woman. And so the campaign chooses Harris. And I think its important to remember it was their best fundraising day that they had all year when they chose Harris.michael barbaroBut the result of this, and I want you to correct me if Im in any way wrong about this, is that shes being put in something of an identity box. And she doesnt like identity boxes.astead herndonIts true. And I think that she does not like being identity first as the reason shes in the room, even if thats part of her worldview. It is a very understandable feeling to say, I dont want to be here only because Im a Black-South Asian woman, period. And it created a situation where the DEI hire framing that, obviously, Republicans have latched on to, was always in the air with her selection. And I think, frankly, it reflects the thinking of the Biden inner circle at the time, the underestimation they had of both her and I think their misconceptions about the political moment at large.michael barbaroExplain that.astead herndonI think its most clear in the policy portfolios she takes on. She was assigned what, I think, is universally seen as a horrible electoral platform, which is the root causes of migration in certain Central American countries.michael barbaroRight. Its like asking someone to solve the greatest riddle in the last 50 years of American foreign policy.astead herndonTotally.michael barbaroAnd Harris knew this was an electoral loser. She actually asked out of the assignment. [LAUGHS]: Can I have something else, please?astead herndonYeah. And Biden made clear, no, this is what I want you to do. And it has immediate impacts.archived recording (kamala harris) I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border astead herndonThink about the infamous press conference she had with the president of Guatemala talking about immigrants.michael barbaroYep.archived recording (kamala harris)  do not come. Do not come.astead herndonThe interview she had with Lester Holt about whether she went to the border or not. There was an understanding that this was a political loser, but it was something that they tasked her with and that she, frankly, just had to soldier on from. The other thing that happens, and I think this is natural with VP office versus West Wing, was there was a push and pull about which events to use her at, particularly in the first couple of years. And to the point about not being want to be put in a box of race and gender, there was a story I heard about a time in which the West Wing wanted her to be used at this event where there was a baby formula shortage that was national news.michael barbaroTotally.astead herndonAnd the administration was doing some efforts to try to make sure they could get more formula. And there was a plane landing that was filled with formula. And the administration wanted to do a photo op taking credit for solving baby formula crisis. Classic political maneuver. And they asked Harris to go. And, again, to the point about when is identity helpful versus when does it put you in a box? This is something she didnt want to do.michael barbaroBe kind of womaned.astead herndonYeah, be put in that box. And I think it reflects the hard choices that sometimes identity can put you in. And so particularly in those first couple of years, that was a push and pull between her and White House. But she largely takes on the assignments that the White House gives her. And most importantly, she maintains an intense sense of loyalty to President Biden that he really appreciates. And so it matters to him that she says, yes, when he reassigns her that immigration assignment, and that she goes to Guatemala, and she does those things right.michael barbaroShe does almost all the things.astead herndonShe does the things that are required of her. The impact is that for the first couple of years of her as VP, shes still dealing with some of the clouds that hung over her during the presidential race. There is a sense that you dont really know what shes doing or what she believes in. But I think that really starts to change around 2022.archived recording (kamala harris) This is the first time in the history of our nation that a constitutional right has been taken from the people of America.astead herndonAfter the Dobbs decision, it creates a lane for her in the administration that she really latches on to.archived recording (kamala harris) I do know that the American people fight for freedom and believe in the womans right to make decisions about her own body.astead herndonAnd she becomes the spokesperson for the administration on the issue and becomes the liaison between abortion rights groups and the White House.archived recording (kamala harris) What has happened here in Arizona is a new inflection point. It has demonstrated once and for all that overturning Roe was just the opening act, just the opening act of a larger strategy to take womens rights and freedoms.astead herndonShe starts embracing the language of freedoms and Democrats protecting reproductive rights.archived recording (kamala harris) And now, because of Donald Trump, more than 20 states in our nation have bans. Now, because of Donald Trump, one in three women of reproductive age in our country live in a state that has a Trump abortion ban.astead herndonThe stump speech was better. It just clarified her pitch because she can go back to something that a lot of people really care about and, most importantly, is at the top of Democrats list. And so I think the first couple of years are education in Washington that may not have happened before she was running for president. But what happened after that was she traveled across the country and, I think, took on a lot of the campaigning efforts that Biden was not doing. And so as a result, she became someone who was more comfortable doing those interactions in a place she wasnt in 2019.michael barbaroAnd perhaps this is why shes ready for what ends up being this extraordinary moment that she encounters a couple of weeks ago.astead herndonYeah, and I think a lot of people were surprised at the speed at which the party unified around her. But it is explained a little more by the work shes done over the last couple of years. When she was going to events as VP, she was calling DNC members and creating those relationships. She was checking in with donors. She was growing a backroom reputation of someone who could lead the party, if necessary. And so when Biden drops and endorses her, she leaned on all of those things to really coalesce support very quickly. And I think there was a greater willingness to see her as someone who could step up to the top of the ticket, because of the advocacy she was doing on issues like abortion over the last couple of years. And so she laid the foundation to really seize that opportunity once it arrived.michael barbaroAnd yet, thats the story of party insiders rallying around her, perhaps a step because of what she did over the past two years as vice president. But it still feels true that the American public doesnt really know what she stands for and exactly who she is. And at this point, its unclear whether thats going to matter in a race where there was so much unhappiness about Biden and Trump. But thats an unusual thing, as we said at the beginning of this conversation.astead herndonYeah. I mean, a lot of the work we are talking about, to your point, is insider political stuff. For most people, I think she was running for president, she became vice president, kind of went away, and now shes the nominee. And so I think that is the reason why Republicans are trying to paint her as flimsy and nonsubstantive. And although at this moment, shes been able to step away from 2019 and say, that wasnt the real version of me, I do think it leads to the question, what is then? And I think over the next three months, the onus is on the campaign to tell that story. And I think that starts at the DNC.michael barbaroLets talk about that story for just a second, because there is a clear story to tell of a young girl who grows up in Black Oakland, child of activists, becomes a prosecutor in the name of bringing that identity and pride inside an institution that she thinks needs to change with her at the center of that change, and the application of that approach of hers to criminal justice, an approach that, like Harris herself, defies being easily put into boxes. Its the story of somebody who believes you can be multiple things at the same time. You can be an empathetic Progressive, but also believe in punishment and in accountability. But my question is, is that a story which we know she didnt want to tell in 2019-2020, that she wants to tell now? The story that you have been telling us here.astead herndonYes.michael barbaroIs that going to be at the center of her campaign?astead herndonYes. I think that the biggest change from 2019 to now is a comfort with that story and a political moment thats more ready to receive it. And so already she has said the words prosecutor maybe more than she said in four years ago. And with Donald Trump on the other side, a convicted felon with looming charges, accountability is on the comeback. And she was going to own that type of framing.michael barbaroA story very faithful to who Kamala Harris was that was hard to sell last time she ran and that she kind of ran away from, now feels like the story she should be embracing and that the country might very much embrace.astead herndonYeah. I think she will return to that articulation. And so the moment of unity were seeing now was always under the surface possible. And I think a lot of that is because she is a vessel that you can see what you want to see in. If you want to see a Progressive, theres enough there you probably can. If you want to see a moderate, you probably can see that too. And so what I think is one of the stories here is a ideological fluidity that was once seen as a problem is now being seen as a solution.michael barbaroAstead, were talking about Kamala Harris here as a candidate in a race thats going to be over in a few months. And youre suggesting that her ideological fluidity might benefit her in a race like this. If she wins, though, the question is going to become, what does that fluidity mean for her as actual president in the hot seat? And what kind of philosophy is this former prosecutor who, as youve laid it out, has always been most comfortable thinking still in the mind of a law and order person? Whats that going to look like when shes commander in chief and leader of the free world?astead herndonAbsolutely. We dont know. But come governing time, all of this fluidity will be put to the test. And we dont know what type of president she would be. I mean, we dont know what the agenda of a Kamala Harris Democratic Party would look like and how that would differ from the one that Biden has laid out. But frankly, if you ask any Democrat, they would say thats tomorrows problem. And as long as she wins the election and stops Donald Trump from winning another term, they dont care. They really dont care.[laughs]Theyll deal with that then.michael barbaroRight. Thats the thing about a tomorrow problem, you deal with it tomorrow.astead herndonYeah. Yeah. Who cares?michael barbaroAstead thank you very much. Really appreciate it.astead herndonThank you for having me. [UPBEAT MUSIC]michael barbaro",

            "text": "As the votes were counted on election night 2016, the first big sign of trouble for Hillary Clinton came from Michigan, arguably the most Democratic of the presidential swing states. In 2020, Joe Biden flipped it back to the Democrats. Now, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump appear to be in a dead heat in Michigan, and its once again crucial for winning the presidency. For our latest Times Opinion focus group, we gathered a cross-section of Michigan voters to assess the race in the home stretch.The takeaway isnt especially positive for Ms. Harris.Our five independents, four Democrats and two Republicans were clear on a few points: Most want significant change in America under the next president, and the bulk of them cite the economy as their top issue and care more about the candidates policies than their values. One voter was troubled by Ms. Harriss support for arms to Israel and is leaning toward Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Others thought Mr. Trump didnt understand what it meant to struggle financially.Perhaps most worrisome for Ms. Harris, nine of our 11 participants thought she would pursue policies similar to Mr. Bidens. Muhammad, a 25-year-old software engineer and registered independent who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020, said he was struck by a recent TV ad showing Ms. Harris on The View saying she could not think of a thing she would have done differently from Mr. Biden during their administration. For him and others, Harris's problems boil down to two words: \"Change\" and \"Biden.\"I understand not pushing Biden under the bus, but she needs to be more authentic and actually take responsibility for the failures of her administration. She was the border czar, and that is a failure. All she needed to do was be authentic about that, Muhammad said.Some participants were enthusiastic about Ms. Harriss energy and ideas and thought that as a woman, she represented change. But as for who will win Michigan and the presidency, these voters thought the race was trending toward Trump, even though several of them saw him as dangerous and unhinged.",

These sweet, crunchy, no-bake snack bars get their name from the way amaranth seeds \"jump for joy\" as they pop in a hot pan, and also from the traditional harvesting method of jumping and dancing on plants to release seeds. Originating in the barrios of Xochimilco, a Mexico City borough famous for its ancient floating gardens, alegras showcase the versatility of amaranth, a drought-resistant plant cultivated for thousands of years. In this recipe, honey, dried cherries and cinnamon combine with anise seeds to give a distinctive licorice flavor that adds depth to the sweetness. Pop your own amaranth if you dont mind a few kernels jumping for joy out of your pan, or use store-bought puffed amaranth for a quick and easy lunchbox or deskside treat.",

One doughnut-shop secret to the perfect apple fritter: use a lot of cinnamon. It is going to seem like a mistake, but fried doughnuts (see Tip) require a lot more apple, cinnamon and salt for the flavor to punch through than if they were baked. The second trick, which achieves that crispy but melt in your mouth texture: chop the dough. It might seem a bit fussy but they dont have to be exact cuts, you just need -inch pieces.

Replace the damp cloth over the remaining pastry sheets to keep them from drying out. Take the bottom-right corner of the rectangle and fold it over the top, with the short side extending 1 to 2 inches past the top. The overlapping pastry at the bottom right of the sheet will form an equilateral triangle with sides that are about 3 inches long. This triangle will be the final shape and size of the samosa. Fold the triangle so its right outer edge is aligned with the horizontal bottom edge of the sheet. There should now be a triangular pocket with two flaps sticking out to the left. Pick up the pocket so it is open and upright like a cone. Fill the cone with 2 teaspoons of the filling. Using the back of a small spoon, spread the flour paste in a thin layer over the remaining strip of pastry. Fold it over the stuffed triangle to seal the samosa. If the corners of the samosa have any gaps, fill them with the flour paste and pinch them to seal. Repeat with the remaining filling and rectangles (you may have leftover wrappers) and lay on the lined sheet pan, spacing apart. They can be fried or baked right away, or frozen on the pan until firm, then sealed in an airtight container or freezer bag. They can be frozen for up to 2 months before frying and go straight into the hot oil from the freezer.",

She spent a lot of time in pubs on early '90s London business trips, and the only vegetarian dish was very often a baked potato. This is where she discovered the ingenuity of filling a soft, steamy potato with all kinds of tasty toppings that absorb nicely into the starchy flesh. In this recipe, she subs out the big potato for smaller, thin-skinned ones (for a prettier presentation), and the bacon bits, chives and packaged cheese for spicier, brighter toppings: chiles, chaat masala, onions and ginger. This dish takes almost no time to put together once the potatoes are baked, but looks very impressive as an appetizer or a small side. Tip: Cut the ginger, onion and chiles while the potatoes bake, so everything is ready for assembly. Priya Krishna",

Canned pumpkin works just fine here, but theres nothing like the jack-o-lantern aroma of fresh steamed squash (see Tip). The action of mashing and stirring a fresh pot of rice until the loose grains hold one shape feels almost as if youre kneading bread, though, Mr. Thiam says, a more accurate parallel would be the act of making fufu, the pounded meal thats central to West African cuisine. Make the rice balls whatever size you like; they make excellent finger food, especially dipped in maaf, the velvety, rich Senegalese peanut stew (often called groundnut stew) that tastes like savoriness incarnate.

Every family has their own version, but at its root, lecs is a paprika-spiced stew with melting onions, peppers and tomatoes. The vegetables are simmered together until saucy, jammy and glossy; the sweetness of the onions and peppers is offset by tomatoes, making this an irresistibly balanced dish that is light but satisfying. Hungarian peppers would be ideal. Typically enjoyed at their yellow stage, they are sweet and savory with a mild heat level. Red bell peppers are more modest, with their predominantly sweet flavor, but make a delicious option for this recipe. The dish, adapted from Pass the Plate by Carolina Gelen (Clarkson Potter, 2024), is vegan as written, but you can use this foundational recipe to make it your own. Some people serve it with fried or scrambled eggs, some with sausage or other meats, some use animal fat to cook the vegetables. Each version will bring comfort and flavor to your table.",

Caramelizing onions takes a good half-hour, so save this recipe for when you have a little extra time and company (this recipe serves two). If time permits, you could even prep them ahead in a slow cooker. Rather than layer the grated Gruyre and the warm caramelized onions in the sandwich, you should stir them together before assembling, which guarantees that the cheese will melt evenly throughout and that each bite will contain the perfect ratio of fragrant cheese to jammy onions. A splash of sherry, red-wine or white-wine vinegar added to the onions balances out the buttery flavors, but a side salad dressed with a tangy mustard vinaigrette would do the trick, too. (Watch the video of Ali Slagle making French onion grilled cheese here.)",

Replace the damp cloth over the remaining pastry sheets to keep them from drying out. Take the bottom-right corner of the rectangle and fold it over the top, with the short side extending 1 to 2 inches past the top. The overlapping pastry at the bottom right of the sheet will form an equilateral triangle with sides that are about 3 inches long. This triangle will be the final shape and size of the samosa. Fold the triangle so its right outer edge is aligned with the horizontal bottom edge of the sheet. There should now be a triangular pocket with two flaps sticking out to the left. Pick up the pocket so it is open and upright like a cone. Fill the cone with 2 teaspoons of the filling. Using the back of a small spoon, spread the flour paste in a thin layer over the remaining strip of pastry. Fold it over the stuffed triangle to seal the samosa. If the corners of the samosa have any gaps, fill them with the flour paste and pinch them to seal. Repeat with the remaining filling and rectangles (you may have leftover wrappers) and lay on the lined sheet pan, spacing apart. They can be fried or baked right away, or frozen on the pan until firm, then sealed in an airtight container or freezer bag. They can be frozen for up to 2 months before frying and go straight into the hot oil from the freezer.",

It relies on bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, and the role of the skin is essential: First, it forms a protective shield when seared, preventing the chicken from drying out in the bubbling liquid as it simmers, and helps build flavor as its fat renders. (Thank the skin for its service and discard it before serving.) The finishing touch of lime adds a nearly imperceptible sour flavor, similar to some Persian stews, that rounds out the braising liquid, which is best enjoyed with bread or basmati rice.",

Brush each donut one by one on all sides - top and bottom - in the melted butter, and then immediately after drop the donut into the cinnamon sugar bowl on both sides to coat the whole donut, gently tossing as needed. Do this one by one. This way the donuts wont absorb the butter and get soggy. And just dropping cinnamon sugar on top of them is really inefficient. 2) Agree with others that 6 TBSPs of melted butter for coating 12 donuts is way too much. You can easily halve it to 3 TBSPs. 3) Agree with others both to be careful about separating ingredients for batter vs coating and that the batter could have more spice! I accidentally put the full 2 TSPs cinnamon in the batter but the donuts smelled and tasted delicious so Id probably do it again on purpose.Is this helpful?",

I put 8 cookies each on parchment lined, full sized baking sheet and yielded 20 cookies. 1T/scoop would work well for bite-sized cookies. They are quite sweet.

            "text": "How Does a Pressure Cooker Work?Dating to the 17th century, the first pressurized cooking pot was developed by the French physicist Denis Papin. Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.A pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers  stovetop and electric  are quite safe. They dont explode as your grandmothers may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.For a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, theyre heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the pots temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isnt hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.With an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cooks having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And dont worry: It wont explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high.",

Even when I added more broth and cream (probably doubling the original measurements) I splashed on some more broth before baking. Two tablespoons of flour would probably be sufficient. As for construction, I would hold out the chicken and sandwich it between layers of the other mixed ingredients. That would ensure even distribution of the protein. With all that said, my husband and I thought it was delicious. Very reminiscent of chicken Tetrazzini, another old-school casserole. (My favorite recipe has a sauce made with 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup flour, 2 cups chicken stock, 1 and a 1/4 cups milk, 1/4 cup dry sherry, and 1 cup heavy cream, salt, pepper, and a hint of nutmeg). Also, Id say the yield of this recipe is 6-8 servings.Is this helpful? 157",

Both the shallots and tomatoes are caramelized along with tomato paste, which gives the soup deeper flavor. Take your time and let the tomatoes reduce, because the more they caramelize, the more delicious the soup will be. While this recipe does take a little bit of time, its mostly hands-off simmering. Make it when the weather turns cool and a big pot of soup simmering on the stove sounds just right.",

I used the brine from 2 - 16 oz pickled jalepeos jars to marinade the pork. I used an Instant Pot at High Pressure for 60 minutes for a 6 lb roast (I doubled the recipe for BBQ and this recipe). Before pressure cooking, I used the saut function and seared the pork on all sides and then I used the Jalepeo brine that this recipe calls for to deglaze the char in the instant pot, this worked as well as a chicken or beef stock.

There are several ways to drop an egg: Beating the eggs lightly will result in both white and yellow swirls, while running a chopstick or wooden spoon through the egg as it cooks will produce long, willowy strands. This recipe calls for dropping the egg into the hot soup and leaving it, which will give you chunks. A tip: If you have a liquid measuring cup with a spout, beat the egg in that, as it will give you more control when pouring the egg into the hot liquid.

(Dont forget to check the egg white mixture and turn off the mixer whenever necessary.) Clip the candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan (its OK if its coated in honey), reduce the heat to medium and boil the mixture without stirring, occasionally swirling the saucepan, until it registers 310 degrees, then remove from the heat immediately. With the mixer running on medium-high speed, stream the sugar mixture into the bowl just as you did the honey. Once youve added all of the sugar mixture, increase the speed to high and continue to beat until the sides of the bowl are warm but not hot and the mixture is very thick, dense and voluminous, about 4 minutes (the mixer might strain against the mixture).",

Underneath, the blueberries become molten as they bake, and the lemon juice brings out apples tart pleasures. Like any warm crisp, this one is best served with a scoop of ice cream.",

One suggestion- the recipe calls for slicing 1/4 inch off of the TOP of the garlic. Ive always roasted garlic by cutting the BOTTOM of the garlic bulb, but did as instructed this time. Immediately, I realized that this was a mistake, as all of the cloves were no longer attached to each other. I tried to hold it all together while getting the little nuggets into the foil, but it was difficult. When I had to squeeze the garlic out, I had to handle each clove individually. Not ideal. Cut the bottom off the cloves will stay connected, and youll just squeeze the whole bulb into the soup. This was delicious, and Ill be making it again later this week for friends.

Delicate brioche is the ideal bread for this pudding, and it is available in most supermarkets, often in the form of hamburger rolls, which are a good size and shape for this dish. Challah is also a good option, but its a bit denser, so it may take more than 15 minutes for it to soak up the custard.",

Also, boiling the pasta in a shallow pan does make it overcooked and creamy, but its also quite dangerous.

I have one tip and one tip only for those who have issues with pork chops tasting bland brine BRINE BRIIIIIIIINE!!! Pork chops like all meat need salt, and its amazing what a simple brine will do for your pork and chicken. We make a simple brine of equal parts (about 1/4 cup) kosher salt and brown sugar and add a few garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and peppercorns. You can play around with any herbs and flavors you want in your brine. Dissolve the salt and sugar, cool it down (for food safety purposes) and stick the chops in to refrigerate for anywhere from 4-12 hours. You could literally just cook them as is at this point, but a brine elevates a recipe like this as well to be amazing and flavorful. Dont skip brining your chops!!!Is this helpful? 1",

Next time, he has said, he will unilaterally send federal forces to bring order to Democratic-run cities.

Justice, in this thinking, is not some ideologically neutral improvement of the human condition but rather a progressive notion of social justice, greater rights and autonomy and triumph over systemic forces of oppression. History has a right side, and it is the left side.Sure enough, the United States has steadily expanded rights and lifted marginalized groups  making good on what Dr. King called the promissory note of the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. American culture has steadily liberalized  tolerating, then accepting, then welcoming a broadening range of beliefs and identities. Thus the boundless confidence of young activists that whatever radical idea they pursue next will someday become conventional wisdom. Thus, too, the nervous and awkward following along by older progressives, who dare not risk a position that might seem reactionary.But what the moral universes long arc really has is survivorship bias. Progressive causes that achieved success and bettered the nation, like the New Deals worker protections and the civil rights movement of the 1960s, are highly visible today and taught in history books as important inflection points. But for every success, there are also many failures  bold ideas that proved not ahead of their time but simply foolish. Having flickered only briefly in the national consciousness, they are easily forgotten.",

            "text": "You awaken in a dirty, empty room. Your foot is chained to a pipe and you have nothing apart from a hacksaw.Two men wake up in an abandoned industrial bathroom, each chained to a pipe. Once they find hacksaws in a toilet tank, they attempt to escape from their thick chains, to no avail.That is when a doctor played by Cary Elwes has a realization about their captor that brings the impossible choice of Saw into visceral focus: He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet.Saw, which was released 20 years ago this week, was never supposed to be a success. It was meant as a low-budget calling card for two Australian film students who were looking to start their careers with a scrappy splash and a neat idea: a serial killer who forces his victims to prove they want to stay alive through bloody sacrificial tasks.Instead, it made more than 80 times its budget at the box office, created a horror villain for the new millennium and inspired the label torture porn, with each installment in the ensuing franchise ratcheting up the disgust.It can be hard to remember two decades later that the original Saw was less interested in gore than morality.What would you do to save your life, or someone elses? said the actor Shawnee Smith, summing up the central tension behind the franchises elaborate traps. In order to expediently escape the reverse bear trap enclosing her head in Saw, Smiths character is forced to locate a key inside another persons stomach. He is drowsy but still alive.In Saw, Cary Elwess character verbalizes the tension and appeal of the franchise: He doesnt want us to cut through our chains. He wants us to cut through our feet. LionsgateElwes, known for playing Westley in The Princess Bride, said that Saw had appealed to him because it was a horror story embedded with ethical and moral questions.Its a thinking persons thriller, he said.The germ of the idea that became Saw was a simple one: two men, locked in a room, with a body lying between them. James Wan and Leigh Whannell, film school classmates at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, had been looking to develop their first feature and kicked around ideas until one stuck. They wrote the script together and Wan directed.Wan, who has gone on to make big-budget Hollywood fare as well as unhinged horror flicks, like Insidious and Malignant, said Saw turned classic tropes on their heads.Oh, youve seen that? Oh, you think you know whats going to happen? Wan said from a dingy basement bathroom in London, a fitting homage to Saw and the only place he could get cellphone service while shooting the next installment of The Conjuring franchise there. Im going to try something else you havent seen before.The classic tropes within Saw  serial killers, haunted detectives, creepy puppets  are mashed together and inverted around the undeniable binary of its core choice.Unlike the winking meta horror fare that preceded it, including horror buff Scream teens and Rube Goldberg machinations in Final Destination, no amount of genre knowledge can save the characters of Saw from having to make an ultimate decision.The film critic David Edelstein described Saw and some of its peers  most notably Eli Roths Hostel (2005)  as torture porn in a 2006 New York magazine essay. But the first Saw is not especially gruesome when compared with the deaths punctuating this years Terrifier 3 and In a Violent Nature.To escape the reverse bear trap enclosing her head, Shawnee Smiths character is forced to locate a key inside another persons stomach. LionsgateSaw is more of a detective thriller with a gruesome twist. The titular tool acts as a rusty Chekhovs gun, while the desperation of the characters provides the terror.The franchises traps are devised by the character John Kramer (Tobin Bell), a terminally ill cancer patient who is angry at people for wasting their lives. Kramer, who would eventually be known as Jigsaw, is technically not a serial killer. Every victim is given the choice to live.Deep down inside, although he is of course somewhat ruthless in this approach, Johns in the business of saving souls, Bell said.That framework came out of Whannells personal experience with recurring migraines in his early twenties. While sitting in a waiting room before a CT scan, he wondered how the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor could change someone.The game seemed to be about time, Whannell, who also plays the second man trapped in the bathroom, said of the killers motives. Hes giving them this time limit and hes making them do these extreme things, like, How badly do you want to live?Saw did not have a simple path to creation. When it came time to actually make the movie, Australian financing fell through.Wan and Whannell were ready to scrape together money to film on the cheap, but Whannells manager, Stacey Testro, thought it could work in Hollywood, where she also had an office. Instead of sending her to court producers in the United States with just a script, the writers made a 10-minute short film of the reverse bear trap sequence with Whannell in the rig.Testro remembers watching the short in her living room, with her luggage by the door and a car out front waiting to take her to the airport. It was just thrilling, she said.Producers at Evolution Entertainment  Gregg Hoffman, Oren Koules and Mark Burg  were impressed enough to give Wan and Whannell a $700,000 shooting budget for the chaotic 18-day shoot, which cut costs by filming mostly in the bathroom set. Wan, who had previously focused on stop-motion animation, also handmade Billy the Puppet, an unsettling ventriloquist dummy with red spiral cheeks, a tricycle and the franchises most famous line, I want to play a game.Wan used papier-mch, table tennis balls for Billys eyes and cardboard boxes to fill out a child-size tuxedo for the body. (At first he also had a bowler hat, Wan said, but it looked slightly too silly.)The limited budget did not prevent the movies ideas from resonating with audiences.The first movie was all about ethics and how far can you go and whats right and whats wrong with humanity, Burg said, recalling that Evolution thought Saw would be its version of David Finchers Se7en (1995).Saw was influenced by Se7en, in which Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are detectives chasing a serial killer who punishes his victims with elaborate setups. New Line CinemaWhannell described his goal for Saw as a mix between Se7en and Cube. In Finchers movie, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are detectives chasing down a serial killer who models his murders after the seven deadly sins, punishing his victims via elaborate setups symbolic of their moral failings. In Cube (1997), an offbeat Canadian science fiction horror film, prisoners in a mysterious jail travel through rooms rigged with traps.The extended Saw franchise  the 11th film is scheduled to come out next year  has not always stuck to the ideas put forward by the first movie. Wan never directed another Saw movie, while Whannell contributed to Saw II and wrote the screenplay for Saw III.In the decades since Saw was released, Wan has directed tentpole franchise entries like Aquaman (2018) and Furious 7 (2015). Whannell has also settled into the directors chair, including The Invisible Man (2020) starring Elisabeth Moss and the upcoming Wolf Man, both modern incarnations of classic horror stories.That success all goes back to the two friends as fledgling filmmakers trying to find a story that felt compelling, and then landing on ethical choices with bloody results.Whannell is proudest of the Saw franchises outsize impact on popular culture. His favorite: In The Sopranos, a character becomes fixated on pitching a movie that he describes as Saw meets The Godfather Part II. Billy the Puppet was recently added to the popular battle royale video game Fortnite.Whether we wanted to or not, Whannell said, we basically created the millennial Freddy Krueger.",

It was also one of only a handful of attacks by a foreign air force in Iran since its war with Iraq in the 1980s.Although it was a significant moment, Iran did not immediately set a time frame for a retaliation. The Iranian foreign ministry said that while Iran was obliged to defend itself, it was aware of its responsibilities for regional peace and security, avoiding the kind of bombastic language that characterized Irans initial responses to previous Israeli attacks.That eased fears that an uncontrollable conflict was about to break out, even if the prospect of such a clash has edged ever closer.",

Despite untold sums spent on advertising, a cavalcade of wild events  from felony convictions to assassination attempts to the incumbent president withdrawing from the race  here we sit, right on a razors edge.Over the past few days, other national news outlets have released polls telling the same story. CNN (where I am an on-air contributor) also had the race tied at 47 to 47 among likely voters. CBS News polling shows the contest effectively even, favoring Ms. Harris 50 to 49 among likely voters. (An exception to the pattern, polling by ABC News was a bit more bullish on Ms. Harris, at 51 to 47 among likely voters.)And yet these polls actually dont tell the same story. Though several of them show a dead heat, beneath the surface, they diverge in how they arrive at that result.Lets take two possible theories for how this election might unfold. The first theory, which Ill call the realignment, is that political divides like race and economic class are being replaced by divides like gender and education level. As the Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria writes: We are seeing a realignment in which the old categories of economic status and race are giving way to new categories such as social status and cultural divides around gender. We are likely at the beginning of this transformation of the political landscape.",

When Betts snagged the ball with his glove above the padded wall, Capobianco gripped Betts glove with both hands, opened it, reached inside with his right hand and knocked the ball back onto the field. The umpires ruled the play fan interference and Torres was out.Capobiancos brother, Darren, 29, said he saw Betts glove go over the concrete wall as he tried to make a catch on Torres hit.I just see the ball kind of  I dont want to say (go) up for grabs, if that makes sense, Darren Capobianco said. And then Mookie was swearing at us. Not good.After the game, Betts said that his wrist felt perfectly fine, and he brushed off questions about the incident, which he called irrelevant because the Dodgers lost.It doesnt matter, Betts said, when asked if hed ever seen fans act so aggressively. We lost, its irrelevant, Im fine, hes fine, everythings cool. We lost the game, thats what Im kind of focused on, turn the page. Everythings fine.Austin Capobianco is a Yankee Stadium season-ticket holder, his brother said.Immediately, security guards walked over to Austin Capobianco, who tried to argue with them that Betts glove had reached into foul territory, according to a video obtained by The Athletic. Ana Flamengo, a Yankees fan from Connecticut, said she was standing on the concourse when stadium security escorted Austin Capobianco from the stands.AdvertisementI saw him being walked out, Flamengo said. I told him he was my hero for trying to save the Yankees. Its the championship game.A league spokesperson confirmed that two fans were ejected.That was one of the most aggressive fan ripping the ball out of his glove (incidents) that Ive ever seen, longtime former MLB umpire Dale Scott said.Dodgers pitcher Ben Casparius, who was on the mound at the time, was simply glad that umps called the batter out. Never seen anything like that, he said. It was interesting, especially I think it being the second or third pitch of the game, an interesting start to the game for sure.The Dodgers Tommy Edman didnt care for how the interaction played out.That looked ridiculous from my perspective, Edman said.The guy was trying to yank (Betts) glove off, pulling at his wrist, looked like he got ejected, and Im glad he did. Ive never seen anything like that. That was unacceptable.The Athletics Evan Drellich, Rustin Dodd and Sam Blum contributed to this story.Required reading(Photo: Robert Deutsch / Imagn Images)",

He repeatedly raised the idea of using troops to secure border states, and even proposed shooting both violent protesters and undocumented migrants in the legs, former aides have said.In his first term in office, Mr. Trump never realized his expansive vision of using troops to enforce the law on U.S. soil. But as he has sought a return to power, he has made clear that he intends to use the military for a range of domestic law enforcement purposes, including patrolling the border, suppressing protests that he deems to have turned into riots and even fighting crime in big cities run by Democrats.In places where there is a true breakdown of the rule of law, such as the most dangerous neighborhoods in Chicago, the next president should use every power at his disposal to restore order  and, if necessary, that includes sending in the National Guard or the troops, Mr. Trump said at a conservative conference in Dallas in August 2022, shortly before announcing that he was running to be that next president.",

Ask her a question to which she doesnt have a canned answer and she struggles for a coherent response. The most notable difference between her current presidential bid and her previous one in 2019 is that she has repudiated many of her past views. Is it because shes hiding her real convictions  or because she has few real convictions at all?Yet Im going to vote for her. Other conservatives should, too.Why? Because Donald Trump is worse. He isnt worse because hes a fascist: If he were, his outspoken opponents would have wound up in prison, not on MSNBC. He isnt worse because his presidency was an unremitting failure: The (prepandemic) economy thrived, Operation Warp Speed was a triumph, the world was more at peace than it is today and there were important diplomatic achievements such as the Abraham Accords. Nor is he the only one who can disrespect political norms: Its Harris, not Trump, who is campaigning on ending the Senate filibuster and perhaps packing the Supreme Court.But Trump is worse in ways that matter profoundly to the rule of law, the health of capitalism and the future of freedom at home and abroad. Conservatives who claim to care about these things should also care about what Trump may do to each of them  and, crucially, do so in the name of conservatism. Consider:Law. Conservatives are indignant about the flimsy civil and criminal cases progressive prosecutors have brought against Trump  cases they almost certainly wouldnt have brought against anyone else.But politicizing justice is exactly what Trump sought to do during his presidency. He tried to strong-arm Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, into participating in a dirt-digging expedition against Joe and Hunter Biden. His Justice Department tried to block a merger between AT&T and Time Warner in 2017, almost certainly out of presidential spite against CNN. He appointed a hack as an acting attorney general and took legal advice from conspiracy theorists, including Sidney Powell.",

In 2000, it took more than a month to determine a winner because of a closely fought race that came down to a recount in Florida, which also involved disputed ballots. In 2020, it took four days to determine that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had defeated the incumbent, President Donald J. Trump. A surge in mail-in voting and closely fought races in several swing states has meant that more votes must be counted before experts can call the race.This election may play out similarly to 2020 because:There is more mail voting and early voting compared with elections before 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic in the 2020 election upended voting patterns for many Americans. So far this year, there are signs that those changes have persisted, with more people voting early and by mail than in previous elections.Most state legislatures prevent counting ballots before Election Day  or even preparing to count them. In Pennsylvania, many voters submit their ballots by mail, but state law prevents election officials from taking steps like verifying signatures and opening envelopes before Election Day. In 2020, it took Pennsylvania four days to determine that Mr. Biden had won the state.Polling also indicates this could be one of the closest elections in history, with the candidates effectively tied across the key battlegrounds. The final result could come down to a few thousand votes in a few swing states, meaning it could be difficult to call the winner in some states before nearly all votes are counted.There are other quirks too. For example, the ballots in Maricopa County, Arizonas most populous region, are spread across two pages this year, requiring election officials to process roughly twice as many pieces of paper compared with 2020. Election officials there said it could take 10 to 13 days to count all the ballots.",

He has shifted his public views on abortion so often that its hard to say what he believes or wants to do. He has said he wants to leave it to the states. More recently, he said he would not sign a federal abortion ban, and would veto one if a Republican-controlled Congress sent it to his desk. He has publicly supported I.V.F., which some anti-abortion groups oppose.But Mr. Trump would also be under pressure from the anti-abortion groups that have ardently supported him to take other actions that would go much further than the 15-week national bans that congressional Republicans have proposed since Roe was overturned. These include reversing federal guidance that says even states with bans must allow doctors to provide abortion in cases of medical emergency; using administrative agencies to ban abortion pills; and using his executive powers to achieve the anti-abortion movements ultimate goal: recognizing fetal personhood in the Constitution.",

Harris, he wrote in an email,has run a surprisingly centrist presidential campaign while the partys progressive wing has bitten its tongue. If she wins, the gloves will come off, and progressives will probably repeat what they did during the first two years of the Biden administration  pressure the new president to support their agenda.But, Galston noted, even if Harris wins,Republicans are likely to take control of the Senate. If so, Harris would be forced to negotiate with a Senate Republican leadership to get anything done, reducing the influence of the left on her administration, and House Democrats would face a choice between gridlock and accepting whatever the administration could get from a Republican-led Senate.How would Harris exercise presidential executive authority?Galston:The answer to this question depends on who she really is  a former progressive mugged by reality and transformed into a Biden Democrat, or an actual progressive who is trimming her sails to close the deal with moderate voters. If its the latter, expect the rule-making process to tilt left, especially on cultural issues. If its the former, the Harris administration will disappoint the left on immigration, crime and education, among other issues.Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic think tank, also replied to my queries by email:If Harris wins it will be because she successfully jettisoned the progressive dogma that doomed Democratic primary candidates in the 2020 cycle and made a convincing case to mainstream voters that she is a Democratic centrist. Her decisive move to the center began on the day Joe Biden stepped back from the race and culminated in her convention speech, which was the most centrist of any Democratic nominee in memory, including Bill Clinton in 1992.Harriss embrace, Kessler continued, ofopportunity economics and capitalism helped her close the economy gap with Donald Trump. Her tough on the border policies have closed some of the border gap with Trump. Her accountability and prevention framing and touting her personal gun ownership has helped her on crime. All of these are tier one issues for voters and issues in which Democrats suffered huge deficits.What if Trump wins?Kessler:If Harris loses, progressives will argue publicly that her moving to the center was the cause. Frankly, I dont think even they will believe it. If you watch the swing state ads against Harris or congressional Democrats like Sherrod Brown, they are devastating frontal assaults on progressive liturgy. Every ad is about chaos at the border, out-of-control city streets, runaway inflation and mischaracterizations on transgender issues.How will Republicans react to a Trump defeat?Lets be realistic, Kessler wrote:There are only two outcomes in the minds of the Trump people  he wins or it was stolen from him. What happens to Republicans after a Trump loss will depend on whether enough Republicans tell Trump that they have lost patience with his stolen election charade. If youre counting on courage from congressional Republicans, dont bet the house on it.Ruy Teixeira, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a co-author of The Emerging Democratic Majority, contended that even before the votes have been counted, the progressive movement in the Democratic Party is dead in its tracks.

Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, charged Trump in Florida for refusing to return classified documents and in Washington for trying to overturn the 2020 election. State prosecutors, both Democrats, brought election-related charges in Georgia and convicted Trump in New York of a hush-money scheme to influence the 2016 election. In his telling, all the cases are witch hunts by Politicized Persecutors. Retorting to Harris at their debate in September, Trump said: They talk about democracy: Im a threat to democracy. Theyre the threat to democracy  with the fake Russia Russia Russia investigation that went nowhere.But there is a fundamental difference between the investigations Trump threatens and the ones hes now subject to. There is no known evidence that Biden instigated these investigations or has tried to influence their outcome. Garland has given Smith authority over how to proceed in the investigations of Trump  and also appointed different special counsels to investigate Hunter Biden and President Bidens own mishandling of classified documents.",

            "text": "NEW YORK  One more day of summer. For every team faced with an early demise in the World Series, thats the vision: one more day of summer to play with your friends. Youll have to face the winter soon enough.So on Tuesday afternoon, under steel-gray skies in the steel-gray fortress of Yankee Stadium, Anthony Rizzo gave voice to what all of his teammates were thinking.AdvertisementToday could be our last drive to the ballpark, said Rizzo, the veteran first baseman. Today could be the last time this teams ever together.The everyday rhythms are part of baseballs charm, the routine a source of comfort in a game so capricious. The New York Yankees did not think they had played very badly in this World Series, yet theyd lost the first three games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. No team in the last half-century had faced that deficit and won another game.We were down 2-0 and we said, Hey, this ss not gonna be easy, but this is what were made for, third baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. said. We lost Game 3 and we said, Hey, who doesnt want to make history? I know I love making history. I love writing my name in the history books and being a part of it. So lets do it.After thumping the Dodgers, 11-4, these Yankees have lots of chiseling to do before carving their place in history as the only team to win the World Series after losing the first three games.But what you heard in their clubhouse after Game 4 was the sound of hope, of a plausible scenario for a singular achievement. On Wednesday, Rizzo noted, the Yankees will face Jack Flaherty and the Dodgers cast of high-leverage relievers. Theyve seen them all before, and theyll be ready.The flight to L.A. will be really special if we make that happen, Rizzo said.Eight years ago with the Chicago Cubs, Rizzo played another Game 5 on Halloween eve, needing a win to extend the World Series. The Cubs trusted an ace starter, Jon Lester, and a well-rested closer, Aroldis Chapman, for a win that clinched a final road trip for a tight group. The Cubs would return from Cleveland as champions.Now the Yankees can use their top starter, Gerrit Cole, to start Game 5, with relief ace Luke Weaver relatively fresh after throwing only 21 pitches Tuesday. The Yankees five-run rally in the eighth padded their lead and saved Weaver from working another inning.Gleyber Torres three-run homer was the big blow then, but the preceding at-bat had the Yankees buzzing. With one out and runners at second and third, Alex Verdugo wore down Brent Honeywell Jr. for 11 pitches. His bouncer to second scored Anthony Volpe and set up the blast that followed.I know he probably didnt put up the numbers in the regular season that he wanted to, Aaron Judge, who was 1 for 3, said of Verdugo. But all year long he just said: Get me to the postseason and Ill do something special. And thats what weve seen so far this whole postseason.Verdugo hasnt actually been Reggie Jackson; hes hitting .200/.280/.311 in October, even worse than his regular season numbers (.233/.291/.356). But his one home run this month came with two on and two outs in the ninth inning of Game 3  a jolt of confidence for a slumbering offense.AdvertisementThe Dodgers started Game 4 just as they had the night before, with a two-run homer by Freddie Freeman in the top of the first. But while it was the same kind of hit, this one packed less punch. The Yankees were too awestruck to be discouraged.My first thought is: this guy is superhuman, Weaver said. Youre sitting there kind of marveling at what hes doing. So youve got to give him all the respect and appreciation for what hes doing on the biggest stage. But, I mean, youre looking at it and its early, right? Youre not like, Oh, its a repeat.It was an all-new episode with a mostly fresh cast of Dodgers pitchers. Three of them were new to this World Series and covered seven innings. The pitcher the Yankees had seen already, Daniel Hudson, allowed Volpes go-ahead grand slam in the third.It really just takes one big swing, and I feel like that was Volpes big swing there, said catcher Austin Wells, who doubled and homered like Volpe. It allowed everyone to just take a deep breath and have fun. I think also the situation we were in, we just kind of needed to say screw it and go after it and have fun because some guys may never come back to the World Series again.Volpe sure had fun; by the end, his muddy uniform was so brown that youd think he played for the San Diego Padres. He lived the fantasy of every New York-born kid of his generation: a shortstop in pinstripes, starring in the World Series. He could get used to this extra month of work.Its my first playoffs, but these have been probably the craziest things Ive ever been a part of, Volpe said. So its just foot on the gas, always.The Yankees stalled for three games. Now the engine is purring. Theyre still tracing a narrow path on the edge of a cliff, trying to do what no team has ever done: not just winning the World Series after losing the first three games, but simply forcing a Game 6.AdvertisementMaybe theyll make history. Maybe  probably  they wont. But theyre still playing, and thats the best they can do for now.I feel like today is a reminder to show you why were in the World Series, why we got this far, Chisholm said, and why we dont expect to be done.(Top photo of the Yankees bench celebrating Gleyber Torres home run in Game 4: Elsa / Getty Images)",

The order, which did not include a vote count, gave no reasoning and was unsigned, as is typical in cases decided on the emergency docket. But it noted that Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson would have denied the states request to continue the voter purge.The case is among a handful of election-related disputes to reach the Supreme Court in the final days before the election. On Tuesday, the justices batted away a bid by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped his independent campaign for the White House in August, to remove his name from the ballots in two crucial battleground states, Michigan and Wisconsin.The voter dispute in Virginia arose in the months before the election, when Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, signed an executive order to hasten the removal of suspected noncitizens from the states voter rolls. In fact, studies show that noncitizens voting is extremely rare, though Republicans, including former President Donald J. Trump and his allies, have continued to deploy the claim.",

            "text": "NEW YORK  Anthony Volpes jersey was caked in dirt as he fielded grounders at shortstop before the ninth inning of Game 4 of the World Series. The New York Yankees were on the brink of a victory that would keep their season alive.Then, the most exhilarating moment of Volpes life unfolded.Like many kids who grew up playing baseball in the New York area, Volpe dreamed of becoming the Yankees shortstop and a franchise icon like his hero, Derek Jeter. While the odds of such a dream coming true are nearly impossible, Volpe now lives it every day.AdvertisementHis deep-rooted Yankees fandom spans generations. His great-grandfather immigrated from Italy and made a living selling fruit from a pushcart in downtown Manhattan. He later fought in World War II and returned home with shrapnel wounds. Volpes grandfather was just 4 years old when his father went to war, and upon his return, they bonded over Yankees games on the radio. Every night, trying to make up for lost time, the two would share stories of life and baseball.Growing up, Volpe wore No. 7 in honor of his grandfathers idol, Mickey Mantle. So Tuesday night embodied a dream fulfilled for Volpe and his ancestors. He launched a go-ahead grand slam in the third inning, giving the Yankees a 5-2 lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers. He also stole two bases, becoming the first Yankee to hit a grand slam and steal multiple bases in a game  regular season or postseason  since none other than Mantle.But the moment that stood out the most came with the Yankees leading 11-4 in the ninth inning. Nearly 50,000 fans at Yankee Stadium erupted and began chanting Vol-pe! Vol-pe! Vol-pe! He turned toward the Bleacher Creatures and saluted them, striving to maintain his composure. Deep down, the 23-year-old was experiencing the pinnacle of his lifes journey.Number one, Volpe exclaimed with pure joy. Definitely number one.Yankee Stadium hadnt erupted like it did Tuesday in 15 years, not since Game 6 of the 2009 World Series. Shortly after that victory, an 8-year-old Volpe watched the championship parade with his family, dreaming of one day parading down the Canyon of Heroes as fans chanted his name the same way he did for Jeter.Fifteen years later, on the set of Foxs postgame show, Jeter playfully ribbed Volpe, suggesting he should have been in school instead of at the parade.AdvertisementBut with the Yankees down 3-1 in the World Series and history against them, Volpe admitted he hadnt fully grasped the significance of Tuesday night.Hopefully, when we win the World Series and Im with my family, we can reflect on everything, Volpe said. It was just a big game. We wanted to go 1-0 today and see where it takes us.Volpe envisioned nights like Tuesday probably every night as a child. He doesnt take for granted that this dream was shared by his friends, his cousins, and his sister, Olivia. But winning the World Series always loomed as his top aspiration.Anthony Volpe could only dream of nights like Tuesday, only this time, he made it a reality. (Sarah Stier / Getty Images)Nothing else compares, Volpe said. So theres still a lot of work to do.Austin Wells, Volpes best friend on the team, felt the ground shake when Volpe hit his grand slam. The two had often discussed what this moment would feel like if they reached this stage together.Wells spent countless nights at Volpes childhood home, poring over old Yankees footage and imagining the electric atmosphere of an October crowd at Yankee Stadium. On Tuesday, he experienced it, hitting a solo home run into the second deck to extend the Yankees lead to 6-4. Earlier, he smacked a double with Volpe on second base; although Volpes base-running blunder may have cost the Yankees an additional run, it ultimately didnt matter as the offense finally broke through against the Dodgers bullpen.Los Angeles opted not to use its high-leverage relievers, believing it will certainly win one of the next three games, rendering a Game 4 loss moot. However, the Yankees faced a must-win scenario. If the Yankees mount a comeback, it will surely deserve its own Netflix documentary, like the Red Sox one on the streaming platform now, and the offensive explosion led by Volpes grand slam in Game 4 should be its starting point.We were down 2-0, but we still said, Hey, this aint gonna be easy, but this is what were made for,' Jazz Chisholm Jr. said. Who doesnt want to make history? I love making history. I love writing my name in the history books.After Game 4, Volpe spent a few moments with the Fox postgame crew, where David Ortiz, well-acquainted with comebacks from 3-0 deficits, gifted Volpe a shirt featuring Big Papi in a Red Sox jersey with the caption, My Dawg! Volpe chuckled, insisting he wouldnt ever wear it, knowing it would be sacrilegious to don Boston gear.AdvertisementYet, even more meaningful than the shirt were Jeters words on set. In the same way he idolized Jeter, countless New York kids now aspire to be like Volpe, dreaming of one day hitting a grand slam in the World Series at Yankee Stadium as the franchises shortstop.And perhaps, if theyre lucky, theyll one day recount how that grand slam led to baseball immortality.(Top photo: Sarah Stier / Getty Images)",

And Arcigay, Italys largest L.G.B.T.Q.+ association, slammed the law as a grave negation of individual rights and announced protests.But the day after the bill passed I checked the newspapers, expecting it to be the main news, and in many cases it wasnt  several papers led with a story about budget cuts instead. Then it more or less disappeared from the news cycle and was confined to small, progressive circles on social media.It was another example of a pattern that has become familiar here: The government of Giorgia Meloni, Italys right-wing prime minister, does something that sparks an outcry among progressives and some media coverage, but fails to really outrage the wider public.

As the two women walked the halls, they stopped in front of a wall lined with photographs of Ms. Harriss predecessors  all of them white men.The expectation of our community is that Im going to fix all the havoc, Ms. Harris said, according to Ms. Simons recollection. Theyre going to want me to fix all the racism, all the dysfunction, in the next four years.But in reality, Ms. Harris said, change will happen bit by bit.The comment underscored the political philosophy that has guided Ms. Harriss style of governance for decades. It is among the more striking contradictions of Ms. Harriss candidacy: While she would bring about historic change if elected, as the first woman, the first Asian American and the second Black person to hold the office, she is not offering sweeping change in policy. She is at heart an institutionalist, defined by a deliberate style, focused on granular impacts over broad society shifts.",

Asked whether they supported Mr. Trumps proposals, a typical response was: Lets see after the election.Ill decide what my position is on it once we see what the whole picture is next year, Senator Michael D. Crapo, an Idaho Republican who could lead the chambers tax-writing committee if his party regains control of the Senate, said last month.The caution is a sign that Mr. Trumps ideas may be too expensive and outlandish for Republicans in Congress to embrace. The rest of the party had been focused on extending the 2017 tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law. Some of Mr. Trumps recent proposals undercut changes that were made as part of that tax package.",

And this election coincides with one of the greatest scientific turning points in human history: the birth of artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., which is likely to emerge in the next four years and will require our next president to pull together a global coalition to productively, safely and compatibly govern computers that will soon have minds of their own superior to our own.Donald Trump  who neglected to even appoint a science adviser until over 18 months into his presidency  is intellectually and temperamentally unsuited to assemble any such global alliance. His administration hastened a vaccine for Covid-19 with one hand and then fostered doubt about using it with the other when it met with a conservative anti-vaccine backlash.Today, Trumps first priority is not capitalizing on the tremendous opportunities that will come from America leading in the use of A.G.I. nor building a global coalition to govern it, but to impose higher tariffs on our allies to block their exports of cars and toys and other goods to the United States. The only technology Trump seems to be deeply interested in is Truth Social, his own version of X. Indeed, since Trump has described himself as a very stable genius, he probably doubts that there could even be an artificial intelligence greater than his own.Kamala Harris, given her background in law enforcement, connections to Silicon Valley and the work she has already done on A.I. in the past four years, is up to this challenge, which is a key reason she has my endorsement for the presidency.",

            "text": "NEW YORK  The hometown kid came to the rescue on Tuesday, saving the New York Yankees from elimination in the World Series.Anthony Volpe, the New York-born shortstop who attended the Yankees last championship parade in 2009 as an 8-year-old, belted a go-ahead grand slam in the third inning of Game 4, powering the Yankees to a 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Bronx.AdvertisementThe Yankees  who got four critical outs from Luke Weaver  became the first team since 1970 to force a Game 5 after losing the first three games of the World Series. The last nine teams facing that deficit had been eliminated in Game 4.Freddie Freeman set a record in defeat, becoming the first player to hit homers in six consecutive World Series games, a streak that began with Atlanta in 2021. Freeman lined a two-run bullet to right in the first inning for the second game in a row, but the Dodgers failed in their effort to clinch the title with a bullpen game.Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers never got much going and the Yankees pulled away with a late offensive explosion. (Elsa / Getty Images)Analyzing the bullpen decisionsHeres the thing with how the Dodgers approached their bullpen game, particularly the third inning: Its largely in line with what worked for them in the National League Championship Series against the Mets when they ran this same playbook twice. The Dodgers got about what they expected out of Ben Casparius. They knew they would need multiple innings out of Landon Knack. Even though everyone was available for the Dodgers, using some of their top arms would have changed the calculus of how they approached a potential Game 5.Having Daniel Hudson take on the heart of the Yankees order brought understandable risk. His production faded over the season, largely because of his propensity for allowing the long ball. It was Volpe  not Juan Soto, Aaron Judge nor even Giancarlo Stanton  who took him out of the ballpark, but there were going be stretches in Game 4 when the Dodgers had to grit their teeth. Hudson clearly didnt have his command despite striking out the scariest matchup in Soto.Knack, warming up as the inning built, was a long-term play. Using another righty for Volpe with the bases loaded wouldve burned another arm for a pocket of left-handed hitters, and using one of their two lefties would have set up a less-than-ideal platoon spot. Using a leverage arm would have ramifications for a potential Game 5 and beyond.AdvertisementSo Hudson faced Volpe. He hung a slider. Volpe had struggled this postseason but did not miss his chance.Yankees provide a formula for a historic comebackThe Yankees had not gotten much production from the bottom of the order in the first three games of the World Series. Entering Game 4, the Yankees 7-8-9 batters had a combined four hits. On Tuesday, they combined for four hits through the first six innings.Volpe delivered that critical grand slam in the third inning, giving the Yankees a 5-2 lead. It was Volpes first home run since Sept. 21 and a reminder that he has power when he connects on a pitch. Volpe abandoned the power approach he showcased in his rookie season so he could increase his contact in Year 2. That decision backfired as he was a worse overall hitter. But for one night, Volpe turned back the clock and became the power-hitting shortstop the Yankees thought he would become.Austin Wells, who has struggled mightily over the past two months, smoked two batted balls. In the second inning, he hit a 406-foot double to center field that would have been gone in 17 ballparks. Wells then hit the ball over the fence in the sixth inning to give the Yankees a 6-4 lead.If the Yankees were to mount a historic comeback in this series, part of the formula is getting production up and down their lineup like they did in Game 4.Dodgers havent maximized their extra looks at the Yankees bullpenFor as much as the Dodgers have seen the Yankees bullpen, they have yet to accomplish what they usually do: take advantage of multiple looks, adjust and find the soft spots to break through. The Dodgers again chased a Yankee starter before he could complete the fifth inning, as Aaron Boone removed Luis Gil before the pitcher faced Shohei Ohtani a third time through the order. Ohtani immediately laced a single off Tim Hill and the Dodgers got two runs in the inning, but New Yorks bullpen wound up going the final five innings allowing zero runs.AdvertisementThrough four games this series, the Dodgers have managed 12 runs off Yankees starters in 16 innings. In 19 2/3 innings against the Yankees bullpen, theyve scored six  and just one since their furious comeback in Game 1. The prevailing theory is that seeing more out of a bunch of relievers should favor the hitters, particularly with fatigue setting in within a series. Its gone the wrong direction on the Dodgers hitters, which kept Games 2 and 3 from being bigger routs and impeded the Dodgers ability to come back in Game 4.Bullpen, Luke Weaver save the dayCloser Luke Weaver pulled off an incredible feat, tearing through the heart of the Dodgers order for four outs, and the rest of the relievers picked up starting pitcher Gil, who lasted just four innings.Weaver entered with two outs and a runner on second base in the seventh with the Yankees ahead 6-4. He immediately struck out Mookie Betts with a runner on second base. In the eighth inning, Weaver continued to dominate, retiring the side by getting Freeman to pop out and striking out Teoscar Hernndez and Max Muncy.Hill (2/3 innings), Clay Holmes (1 1/3 innings) and Mark Leiter Jr. (2/3 innings) combined to be the bridge to Weaver.In the ninth  with a seven-run lead thanks to a five-run eighth-inning rally  Tim Mayza finished things off with a 1-2-3 ninth.The Yankees will undoubtedly go into Wednesday with a tired bullpen. But facing elimination, all bets are off regarding whether Boone will rest anyone. If the Yankees can prevail, they will have Thursdays off day to recover before Game 6 on Friday in Los Angeles. Fortunately for them, they will start ace Gerrit Cole, who has been a workhorse throughout his career but hasnt topped 89 pitches in any of his four starts this postseason.(Top photo of Anthony Volpe: Elsa / Getty Images)",

His music is poetic, emotionally direct even in its stranger moments and suggestive of deep vulnerability: a unique and potent combination. On the concert stage, where everything becomes more highly charged, it can be overwhelming.Earlier this month, I played his piano concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. I came offstage feeling altered, as I so often do after performing Schumanns music  as if I had seen his innermost self and, in the process, accessed my own. Moments later, in the green room, I heard the questions Ive grown accustomed to but still steel myself against: Had Schumann already gone mad when he wrote this work? Can I hear the madness in the music?Schumann did indeed suffer from severe mental illness; he was institutionalized for the last years of his life. And there is no denying that as his condition worsened, the character of his music changed: It turned inward and grew increasingly static, still conveying his essence but somehow more aloof from the listener. And yet these questions always bother me. They reduce this beautiful, complicated, staggeringly gifted person to a pathology.More dangerously, they indicate a persistent and pernicious stereotype: the tortured artist. Think of the popular conception of the raging Beethoven, the anguished van Gogh, the volatile Caravaggio, the idiosyncratic Vladimir Horowitz, the guitar-smashing rock star.",

In 2020, misinformation and conspiracy theories flourished as vote counting dragged on in a handful of key battleground states. So for this Election Day it is critical that people know what to expect, the true nature of the likely delays and how some of them might have been prevented.Since 2020, Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have either added rules that could slow down their vote counts, or allowed existing rules that contributed to long tabulating times in 2020 to remain in place. Only Michigan and North Carolina have meaningfully changed their laws to speed up the process. (Fortunately, Georgia historically counts quickly; Trump-aligned members of the state election board recently tried to impose rules that would have slowed the process down, but Georgias courts rejected the attempt.)The result is a patchwork of new developments and old laws  a few of which are encouraging, but many of which are troubling.

No reason to go under the knife just yet.A new clinical trial has overturned that thinking, suggesting that those patients would be much better off having their valves replaced right away with a minimally invasive procedure.The trial, whose results were published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine, could change the way doctors treat severe aortic stenosis, a narrowing of the valve that controls blood flow from the heart. The disease, which has a prognosis worse than that of most cancers, afflicts more than 3 percent of people ages 65 and older. It is expected to become more common as people live longer.Replacing peoples heart valves, even if they were not yet experiencing any ill effects, appeared to roughly halve their risk of being unexpectedly hospitalized for heart problems over at least two years, the trial found.",

He celebrates political violence. The list goes on, and it is familiar by now.A central question about a second Trump term is how this hostility might manifest itself. The countrys political system survived his first term, after all, and many Americans understandably wonder how much different a second term would be.It really could be different.Trump is now far better positioned to accomplish his goals, as my colleagues Maggie Haberman, Charlie Savage and Jonathan Swan have explained in a series of stories. His aides are vetting job candidates for loyalty, trying to exclude establishment Republicans who might resist his wishes. Both Congress and the judiciary would likely be friendlier to him than they were eight years ago.In todays newsletter, I want to help you understand the main ways that Trump could undermine democratic traditions. Along the way, Ill point to Times coverage from the past two years. I will also address some objections that I expect some readers to have.",

The gap by education is 29 points, with Mr. Trump ahead 10 points among people without a college degree and Ms. Harris ahead 19 points among those with one. But broken up by gender and education, we see that the gaps are driven particularly by men without a college degree and women with a college degree, with an overall difference of 43 points. Source: Pew Research, survey of U.S. adults conducted from Sept. 30 to Oct. 6, 2024.We are truly looking at two different Americas when we dig into the views of men without college degrees and women with college degrees. They are at opposite ends of the spectrum politically and experience essentially separate economies, and therefore give priority to distinct sets of character traits and issues.Lets take a closer look. Women with college degrees, who are generally more financially secure than other women, name abortion as one of the key issues deciding their vote, while both women and men without degrees tend to focus more on issues affecting their day-to-day finances or safety. While inflation affects everyone, it hits non-college-educated voters who feel they are falling behind hardest, especially now that the unemployment rate has been rising among those with less than a high school diploma.Our research indicates that economic issues matter deeply to many men without a college degree, who respond strongly to populist messages aimed at acknowledging their anxiety, sense of loss and resentment.These two groups also consume media in entirely different ways, which affects what they see and hear. Men  including those without college degrees  often spend time on X and Reddit, and many listen to podcasts and YouTube personalities concentrating on gaming, sports and politics. Women are more likely to frequent TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. Many seem more focused on content about personal growth, true crime and style.With the contrasts in priorities and worldview between these two groups, it makes sense that they would have different voting patterns, and the presence of a woman on the Democratic ticket has only accentuated that. Recent polling by the Pew Research Center shows non-college-educated men choosing Mr. Trump at a rate of 55 percent to 39 percent; college-educated women are nearly the inverse, favoring Ms. Harris by 61 percent to 34 percent. The gap may be even bigger by Election Day; it could be the largest in history.The large split between non-college-educated men and college-educated women began in 2016 +20 R (poll) Non-college men +10 R 0 43 pt. gap +10 D 39 pt. gap 41 pt. gap +20 D College women +30 D KerrY Bush Obama McCain Obama Romney Clinton Trump Biden Trump Harris Trump +40 D 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 +20 Rep.

KerrY Bush Obama McCain Obama Romney Clinton Trump Biden Trump Harris Trump +40 Dem. 2004 2008 2012 2016 2020 2024 Sources: American National Election Studies, Pew ResearchThis isnt a new trend. College-educated women have consistently voted for Democrats at high levels for years. But the divergence between non-college-educated men and college-educated women this year seems likely to surpass even its 2016 level.Mr. Trumps appeal to non-college-educated men is part of whats driving this shift. Before 2016, the gap between college-educated women and non-college-educated men was not as broad. But while Joe Biden made inroads among non-college-educated men in 2020, gaining 5 percent more of their vote compared to Hillary Clintons share in 2016, current support for Ms. Harris among men without college degrees has dropped back down almost to Mrs. Clintons 2016 levels. This could certainly in part be due to gender biases; non-college-educated men tend to be less receptive to the idea of women in executive positions. A study found that men without college degrees are least confident that a woman has what it takes to run a major American company (78 percent are confident compared to 91 percent of college-educated women). Our research suggests that they worry whether women are strong enough, can be respected by foreign leaders and are able to boost manufacturing.This campaign in particular shows that both parties have problems with key demographics. Years ago, Democrats could count on support from male union workers, but Mr. Trump is increasingly winning over those voters  not only because of his direct, emotional appeals to their anxiety and values, but also because Democrats have struggled to establish a compelling enough populist economic message or break into the media ecosystem that non-college-educated men consume.Mr. Trumps running mate, JD Vance, seems to have an especially potent attraction for some of these working-class voters. Increasingly, Republicans are the party of working- and middle-class people, said Mr. Vance, whose familys working-class background could be a powerful tool to bring in these non-college-educated men who turned to Mr. Biden in 2020, particularly white ones.As for Ms. Harris, she is particularly appealing to educated women. Republicans used to be stronger than Democrats with college-educated women, but that started to change in the 1980s with Ronald Reagan. Contemporaneous research indicated that educated women were more secular and more progressive on social issues than other voters at the time. They also supported government programs to provide a safety net and opportunity for all (sound familiar?). They opposed the Reagan tax cuts and deregulation and feared war. But many stuck with the Republican Party through the 2000s as part of the security mom coalition. We saw echoes of this in 2022 when Republican candidates in New York and elsewhere were able to leverage safety concerns to win over enough of these women to prevail on Election Day.Donald Trump on Joe Rogans podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, via YoutubeKamala Harris on Bren Browns podcast Bren Brown, via FacebookMs. Harris has been able to use abortion rights to bring back some women with college degrees who might otherwise have stayed with the Republicans. She already had a record of defending reproductive rights, and this year, she visited swing states to speak about abortion. Even in the early days of her campaign, she focused on abortion rights, vowing to restore the rights that had been enshrined in Roe v. Wade and organizing events in battleground states devoted to the issue. Women with college degrees were already a core base for Ms. Harris and the Democratic Party, but these moves helped increase her support among women of all ages. She and her campaign know that she needs to register and turn out voters who favor abortion rights to offset the non-college-educated men Mr. Trump is poised to win.While it might seem impossible for a candidate to appeal to both non-college-educated men and college-educated women, there are areas where policies and messaging could bridge the gap.A populist message, for example, could win more men without college degrees without alienating college-educated women, as anti-corporate sentiment is common among voters across the political spectrum and can play into concerns about both economic issues and freedom from control. Either party could leverage this sentiment.Both groups seem to want investments in public education and job skills training. Many in both groups are worried the next generation will not be as well off as the one before. Many want clean air and water and worry about pollution. Non-college-educated men tend to want to preserve natural areas for recreation like hunting, our data indicates, while college-educated women are particularly concerned about climate change. Both groups seek more respect and power, our research shows, and both see politics as a zero-sum game. The divide between these two groups seems unlikely to change before Election Day, but for either party to bridge the gap in the long term, it will need to work to appeal to both groups.The story of this election could well be the gender gap between those Americans who went to college and those who didnt. As the candidates consolidate support among their base, the divide between college-educated women and non-college-educated men seems almost impossible for Ms. Harris or Mr. Trump to overcome. The big question for America going forward is, can these two groups be brought together after a campaign that has only driven them further apart?Celinda Lake, president of Lake Research Partners, was one of two lead pollsters for Joe Bidens 2020 presidential campaign.

            "text": "Donald Trumps rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night was supposed to be the capstone event of his campaign, a triumphant celebration of authoritarian strength. With millions watching, he would march into the final week of the contest as a conquering champion, so popular he could fill an arena in deep-blue New York twice over.Having energized his most fervent supporters, he would send them out to do whatever it took to return him to the White House. That was the idea, at least. But what works in theory does not always deliver in practice, and in practice, Trumps climactic rally at Madison Square Garden was nothing short of a disaster.Did Trump have the crowds he wanted? Yes. But that was the extent of his success that night. His overall message was dark, disturbing and as autocratic as you might expect from a man whose top officials have been warning us about his fascistic tendencies. Were running against a massive, crooked, malicious leftist machine thats running the Democrat Party, Trump said. They are smart and vicious, they are the enemy within, we must defeat them.Overshadowing the crude authoritarianism of Trumps remarks, however, were those of nearly every other speaker at the podium, who illustrated  each in his own way  the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the MAGA movement. There was, of course, the comedian from Texas who let loose a string of offensive jokes aimed at Blacks and Latinos, relishing the permissive atmosphere. Unfortunately for Trump, one of those jokes was an anti-Puerto Rican remark so racist that it galvanized some of the most prominent figures in Puerto Rican cultural life (This is what they think of us, Ricky Martin wrote in Spanish to his millions of followers on Instagram) and may have jeopardized the campaigns standing in Pennsylvania, where hundreds of thousands of Hispanic Americans of Puerto Rican descent live.",

The list of Ukrainian cities and towns largely leveled to the ground by Russian bombs and artillery grows with each passing month.Russian forces have moved forward in small increments, sustaining a staggering number of casualties to take cities like Avdiivka, which Moscow captured in February. They are now closing in on the nearby city of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian stronghold in the east.In recent months, the fighting has spread to the Russian-Ukrainian border area. In early May, Russian forces launched an offensive in Ukraines northeast, seizing several settlements in a push near the city of Kharkiv. In August, the Ukrainian Army crossed into Russias western Kursk region in a surprise assault that brought the war into the Russian territory in a way never before seen, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to evacuate.Away from the front, millions of Ukrainians have spent hours in bomb shelters as Russia rains down missiles and drones on military units and civilians across the nation. Ukraines energy grid, severely damaged, is working but sporadically. Thousands of schools, hospitals and cultural institutions have been damaged or destroyed. Millions have lost their homes.For all that time, photographers with The New York Times and other news organizations have chronicled the war, capturing a slice of how soldiers and civilians have experienced it.

Abdur-Rahim was 43.The school said in a statement that complications arose during his treatment at a Tampa-area hospital.All of us with South Florida Athletics are grieving with the loved ones of Coach Abdur-Rahim, athletic director Michael Kelly said in a statement. He was authentic, driven, and his infectious personality captivated all of Bulls Nation. Coach Abdur-Rahim leaves a lasting impact on our student-athletes, the University, and the community.AdvertisementAbdur-Rahim was seen as a rising star in the profession and a potential major program coach. He led a remarkable turnaround in his first season with the Bulls last year, earning unanimous American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year honors. He coached South Florida to a school-record 25 victories, its first regular-season conference title ever, its first appearance in the polls and its first NIT appearance in more than a decade.Before taking over the Bulls in March 2023, Abdur-Rahim, a Georgia native, guided Kennesaw State to 26 wins and its first trip to the NCAA Tournament after the program went 1-28 in his first season at the helm (2019-20).The Southeastern Louisiana graduate also spent time as an assistant at Georgia and Texas A&M.In a very short time, Coach Abdur-Rahim made an indelible impact on the University of South Florida, school president Rhea Law said. Throughout my time working with Coach Abdur-Rahim, I was continually inspired by his leadership, and truly admired his sincere approach to connecting with our entire student body. His influence on our student-athletes, coaching staff and the university community will live on forever.Corey Staniscia witnessed Abdur-Rahims influence and sincere connections firsthand as the director of the Bulls Fowler Ave Collective. Abdur-Rahim sent random supportive text messages. More than once, he hung around the campus Starbucks and put students drinks on his tab.The last time Staniscia saw him, he asked how the team was jelling. Abdur-Rahims answer: Im getting them to love each other.That man loved his athletes and what he did, Staniscia said. He truly did care about them.We couldnt have asked for a better person to be here.Abdur-Rahim is survived by his wife, Arianne Buchanan, and three children, Laila, Lana and Aydin. His older brother, Shareef, was a longtime forward in the NBA.Abdur-Rahims death comes less than a week before South Floridas scheduled exhibition against Edward Waters. The school did not announce an interim coach.(Photo: Chris Jones / Imagn Images)",

In a nearly 80-minute speech, Ms. Reeves announced about 40 billion pounds ($51.8 billion) in tax increases, more than half of which would come from higher taxes that employers pay on their workers salaries. She also increased capital gains and inheritance taxes.The choices that I have made today are the right choices for our country, Ms. Reeves said.

Neither did the threat of fines: A violation carried a potential fine of up to $300, and hundreds of people received tickets each year.But after decades of mostly turning the other way, city officials finally decriminalized jaywalking, crossing against a traffic signal or outside a crosswalk. The City Council passed a bill last month to allow pedestrians to cross the street wherever they please, and it became law over the weekend, after Mayor Eric Adams ran out of his allotted time to decide whether to veto or sign the bill.",

They are considered especially dangerous because they are hard to intercept.They suddenly go boom, said Stanislav, a retiree, describing the attacks. We are worried.Glide bombs have been deployed by Russian forces to pound Ukrainian frontline positions throughout the war, and have been used against cities close to the Russian border, like Kharkiv, in recent months. But major cities farther from the border, like Zaporizhzhia, that were once seen as out of reach of the weapons are increasingly being struck, local officials, residents and military experts say.",

            "text": "Once Top Advisers to Trump, They Now Call Him Liar, Fascist and Unfit Many of those who served in former President Donald J. Trumps administration  especially his generals, ambassadors and other national security officials  have since turned on Mr. Trump.Former President Donald J. Trump often brags about hiring the best people. But the breadth of the criticism aimed at Mr. Trump, especially from his own former military and national security officials, sets him apart from any modern president.Gen. Mark Milley Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman John Kelly Chief of staff John Bolton National security adviser Nikki Haley U.N. ambassador Rex Tillerson Secretary of state Mike Pompeo Secretary of state Play John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general who served as Mr. Trumps chief of staff, recently called his former boss an authoritarian, saying he admires people who are dictators  he has said that. So he certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.Mark Milley, the countrys top military official during the last two years of Mr. Trumps presidency, privately told the journalist Bob Woodward that Mr. Trump is a fascist to the core and said his pursuit of another four years in office makes him the most dangerous person to this country, Mr. Woodward revealed in a recent book.Mr. Trump and those around him rejected the criticism as little more than sour grapes. The former president has called General Milley a loser and worse, and has suggested that the decorated military officer should be executed for treason because of efforts to ease concerns among foreign leaders after the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by Mr. Trumps supporters.But the comments from Mr. Kelly and General Milley denigrating Mr. Trumps capacity to serve as commander in chief are particularly striking, even as they echo the sentiments from others across his government and many Republicans outside of his administration.Former generals, admirals, diplomats, intelligence officers and security strategists have publicly or privately accused Mr. Trump of being a liar who lacks basic knowledge about the world and represents a danger to democracy. Members of his cabinet have questioned his loyalty to the country and testified to his chaotic behavior. His press aides have talked about his lack of integrity and his tendency to attack others.And Mike Pence, his own vice president, has accused him of being reckless and putting himself over the Constitution. And Mr. Pence said he walked away from the agenda backed by conservatives. Mr. Pence ran against Mr. Trump and refused to endorse him.Only a few of the former presidents advisers have played an active role in trying to defeat Mr. Trumps bid for another four years in power, often citing their belief that military and national security officials should not meddle in partisan politics. Most have not appeared in ads or sat for recent TV interviews. Just a handful have endorsed Mr. Trumps opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.But they have not disowned their comments about the former president and the danger he poses if he returns to the Oval Office. In recent weeks, Ms. Harris has begun running campaign ads citing the comments from some of the former Trump officials as evidence that he is unfit to serve again.Mr. Trump could regain power soon, and those who advised him the first time have said he is A Threat to Democracy Mr. Trumps national security aides repeatedly described him as a danger to the country and to democracy. Many cited the Jan. 6 violence and his reaction to it as evidence of how he posed a threat to the countrys laws and norms. Others predicted a return to the White House would damage the countrys national security. Surely you cant mean Hitlers generals? And he said, Yeah, yeah, Hitlers generals. John Kelly Chief of staff , said in a recent interview, recalling when Mr. Trump praised the loyalty shown by German generals. Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people  does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. James Mattis Secretary of defense Donald Trump will cause a lot of damage if he is elected in a second term. John Bolton National security adviser The American people deserve to know that President Trump asked me to put him over my oath to the Constitution, but I kept my oath and I always will. Im running for president in part because I think that anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States. Mike Pence Vice presidentIll-Informed and Incurious Several officials have publicly questioned Mr. Trumps intelligence, accusing him of knowing little about history and saying they observed him struggling to understand the complexities of the presidency. Some said he appeared not to be interested in learning about the issues he confronted. Trump lacked basic knowledge of how the government runs, and his impatience with learning about the roles of his senior officials and about alternative models for decision-making limited his ability to lead. When there was conflict, he avoided it or, at times, stoked it. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser His understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of U.S. history was really limited. Its really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesnt even understand the concept for why were talking about this. Rex Tillerson Secretary of state His short attention span (except on matters of personal advantage) renders coherent foreign policy almost unattainable. The United States missed an incalculable number of opportunities in Trumps first term because senior officials necessarily concentrated on keeping a few key policies on track. John Bolton National security adviserDishonest Some members of Mr. Trumps national security team accused him of lying while he was president. Several said he fabricated stories or willingly ignored facts. Others said they witnessed him lying about the results of the 2020 election despite knowing the truth. Trump was caught in a vortex created by the interaction of those narratives with the fragility of his ego and his deep sense of aggrievement. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser Our president must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country. The most important being truth. This president is not able to do that. James Comey F.B.I. director , said after Mr. Trump fired him from his job So many people who had access to his ear who were telling him things, most of which were untrue, and then he began to listen to those voices and form a view that had no basis in fact. Rex Tillerson Secretary of stateMisplaced in His Loyalty Some former aides said Mr. Trump was not loyal to his constituents because he failed to follow a standard conservative agenda. Many questioned his loyalty to the country after witnessing his actions after the election of 2020. Others said he proved disloyal by ignoring rules that govern how sensitive documents are handled. His ego and love of self distorted his perception of the 2020 presidential election. His sense of betrayal drove him to abandon his oath to support and defend the Constitution, a presidents highest obligation. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser He thought I would be loyal and obedient to him. I told him we were loyal to our oath to the Constitution. If he told you to slit someones throat, he thought you would go out and do it. John Kelly White House chief of staff The president has very little understanding of what it means to be in the military, to fight ethically or to be governed by a uniform set of rules and practices. Richard Spencer Secretary of the NavyDisorderly and Undisciplined National security advisers and military officials working for Mr. Trump said he created political and diplomatic chaos while in office. Some said they believed he enjoyed causing discord, while others said he pursued policies that triggered strife and disagreement among global allies. Some said he had a temper that added to the sense of chaos. He acts on his instincts. In some respects, that looks like impulsiveness, but its not his intent to act on impulse. I think he really is trying to act on his instincts. Rex Tillerson Secretary of state Hes getting meaner and more offensive by the day. Hes trying to bully me and anyone who supports me. Nikki Haley U.N. ambassador , said while she was running against Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. John Kelly White House chief of staffA Lawbreaker Several of his national security advisers noted that Mr. Trump faces multiple indictments , including federal charges that he sought to overturn the 2020 election. He has denied breaking the law in all of the cases. This is beyond wrong and illegal. Its un-American. The President undermined American democracy baselessly for months. Tom Bossert Homeland security adviser , said after the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6 Ive never seen a defendant beg for it more. By attacking the judge, attacking the jury, attacking the witnesses. James Comey F.B.I. director , said when asked if Mr. Trump would be sentenced to jail time after being convicted of falsifying business records. Todays violent assault on our Capitol, an effort to subjugate American democracy by mob rule, was fomented by Mr. Trump. James Mattis Secretary of defenseLacking in Integrity One common theme among the former presidents most senior military and national security officials was what some described as a lack of integrity. Several said he was motivated only by self-interest, rather than what was good for the country or the government. Others commented on his ego or used the word unfit to describe him. I think hes unfit for office.  He puts himself before country. His actions are all about him and not about the country. Mark Esper Secretary of defense The facts, however, are clear that he is unfit to be President. If his first four years were bad, a second four will be worse, dismaying many ardent supporters. Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster National security adviser This president is unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His leadership is transactional, ego driven, and about personal loyalty. James Comey F.B.I. directorSimilar warnings about Mr. Trump have come from his other top advisers: almost half of his cabinet, as well as his attorney general, among others. These officials rang the alarm both during and after Mr. Trumps presidency  in books, interviews, essays, speeches and television appearances.People who once worked for Mr. Trump at the highest levels now describe him as unintelligent, chaotic, a danger to American democracy and more. What follows is not an exhaustive list, but rather a representative collection of criticism from Mr. Trumps top advisers.",

            "text": "Jaxson Darts feathered blond hair was tucked under a black hoodie, zipped tightly to his chin. Stone-faced, the quarterback couldnt stop shaking his head in disbelief.I dont understand how we lost, he said.We should win that game, coach Lane Kiffin said.Ole Miss had already suffered a loss to Kentucky. This one landed harder.AdvertisementWe have followed a plan that was deliberate and intentional to make an effort to be in this first 12-team Playoff, said Walker Jones, the executive director of The Grove Collective. That started two years ago.It culminated this fall, Jones said, having invested more than $10 million into a roster loaded with talent and highly recruited transfers. Jones said that number likely ranks among the top half of SEC programs.No. 18 Ole Miss goal is still technically in reach, but the 29-26 overtime loss to LSU on Oct. 12 sharply steepened the odds. Among the remaining opponents this season is No. 2 Georgia. The Rebels host Oklahoma this Saturday.Name, image and likeness, with the NCAA forced by the courts to allow athletes to monetize it in 2021, quickly became the most important fuel for roster building in college sports endless arms race. Third-party collectives affiliated with schools became responsible for facilitating it, and Ole Miss was among the schools at the forefront of using the transfer portal to its advantage.GO DEEPER College football portal confidential: How tampering, NIL deals and portal chaos happenNow, even as the way of doing business is changing again amid the House v. NCAA settlement, and with Ole Miss saddled with two losses, it would be easy to decry the roster as money wasted, to point to a program that fell short of its goals.Jones has the same response to that sentiment he gave to countless donors during two years spent frantically fundraising.I dont know if were going to get to the Playoff, he said, days before the loss to LSU. But I know how were not gonna get there. Were not gonna get there if we dont invest in a plan and commit to it.Jones was a former Ole Miss team captain and linebacker from 1994 to 1997 who later worked as the director of sports marketing for Under Armour and became an agent. He founded his own business before agreeing to lead Ole Miss NIL collective in the middle of 2022.To educate the fan base and put a face on Ole Miss approach to NIL, he convinced athletic director Keith Carter to hold a news conference alongside him and Rebels coaches that fall. Despite alerting the SEC beforehand, that aggressive approach earned Carter a cautionary call from the conference afterward.AdvertisementOle Miss, Carter said, is intentional about being aggressive as a means of making up ground between it and competition with bigger budgets and that has had more success traditionally.The NIL world and compliance, its a lot about risk management now. How far do you think you should go? Can you go? Weve walked that tightrope pretty well. Weve been aggressive, Carter said. And weve done well with some of those calculated risks. And the playing field is leveled some with the new model.Jones built relationships with big-money donors and built a subscription platform for fans who could pledge only tens or hundreds of dollars a month.On the field, Dart was showing promise as a sophomore first-year starter. The winds of change were blowing heavily toward an expanded Playoff, making Ole Miss dreams of inclusion more within reach. That December, the 12-team Playoff to launch in 2024 became official.We made a decision with coach Kiffin and others that said, Hey, if were gonna get in that 12-team Playoff, we need to start now, Jones said. I stop short of saying all-in, Playoff-or-bust narrative. But it was an intentional and deliberate approach to put a team together this year to be one of those 12.Roster building means managing three worlds: high school recruiting, roster retention and, yes, the portal. The collective must work closely with the coaching staff.Kiffin quickly agreed to stay mostly uninvolved with how much players were making, Jones said, and The Grove Collective leaves coaches out of financial decisions and negotiations with players. Like most of the more well-funded collectives, The Grove Collective has its own system of metrics and analytics it uses to find valuations for individual players, based on their positions and the teams needs.In 2023, Ole Miss signed 23 prospects to land the nations No. 2 transfer class, according to 247Sports, building on what Ole Miss had already started when it also landed the No. 2 class in 2022. Only four teams signed more transfers, and Louisiana Tech transfer Tre Harris highlighted the class. Harris leads the nation in receiving and had a highlight touchdown catch in the loss to LSU before being sidelined by an injury.AdvertisementIn 2024, the Rebels added 25 more transfers to sign the nations top portal class, with Kiffin embracing his status as the sports Portal King. Five-star defensive lineman Walter Nolen came from Texas A&M to highlight the class alongside Florida edge rusher transfer Princely Umanmielen, Alabama corner transfer Trey Amos and South Carolina receiver transfer Antwane Wells Jr.In the first year, the collective, Jones said, spent far less on roster retention than in the next year. Key contributors wanted to be paid more for their efforts.The speed-dating aspect of recruiting the portal meant enlisting team leaders like Dart, Harris and 325-pound, two-way player JJ Pegues to vet players and sign off on the dynamics of bringing transfer players into the program after they visited campus.The market is settling, Jones said, but any good collective has to be nimble entering each new portal window as players, agents and collectives learn more about how to operate. And the portal works both ways.Star running back Quinshon Judkins announced in January he was leaving Ole Miss for Ohio State after rushing for more than 2,700 yards and 31 touchdowns the previous two seasons. Ohio State athletic director Ross Bjork told ESPN earlier this offseason the Buckeyes had $20 million to spend on their 2024 football roster.Jones and The Grove Collectives efforts in two short years have made waves. Kiffin said in a news conference earlier this year that former Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze had attempted to pull Jones from his alma mater to help Auburn operate its collective. Jones said he got a chuckle out of it.In September, Arkansas athletic director Hunter Yurachek called out Arkansas fans at an event and said they needed to grow their numbers to be more like Ole Miss collective.AdvertisementNobody loves that Ole Miss is in the top five, right? No. We hate it, Yurachek told cameras and a crowd gathered at an event for program supporters.The Grove Collective boasts 6,000 paid subscribers, Jones said, a large portion of whom had never given to Ole Miss before the NIL era and are under 35.But the shocking home loss to Kentucky and the crushing defeat in Death Valley have caused the wheels underneath the fast start to wobble. What now?This isnt a one-shot wonder. Were going to continually build rosters that are relevant nationally and in the top 12 and trying to get into the Playoff every year, Carter said. If we dont get in the Playoff this year, it isnt over. Were just getting started.What that looks like in the future is still unfolding. The House v. NCAA settlement, granted preliminary approval earlier this month, could bring new rules and guidelines to roster management as soon as the summer of 2025.Some collectives might be brought in-house. Some might partner with schools. Some might stay independent but closely connected to the athletic departments they bolster. Each school will have to decide which model fits it best. The NCAA is looking to monitor true market value with a clearinghouse that would vet all NIL deals worth more than $600.Revenue sharing, a major result of the settlement, with schools paying players directly, is expected to be set at a little more than $20 million next year and will rise as television deals grow more valuable.The limited information we have is there will be two buckets of money: the revenue sharing thats mandated from the settlement and incremental, third-party, market-based NIL, Jones said. The second bucket, NIL, will be much harder to police and value, and there isnt going to be a cap to it. One school might say, Were gonna spend another $30 million on top of that rev share. Another school might say, Well, we only have $5 million we can spend.Jones and The Grove Collective want to make sure Ole Miss is closer to the first group than the second.(Photo of Ole Miss players Jamarious Brown, left, and Walter Nolen: Jonathan Bachman / Getty Images)",

            "text": "25 Jump Scares That Still Make Us Jump The floor creaks, the music turns ominous and an uneasy quiet sets in. Then BAM! Its the classic jump scare. This staple of horror movies, when done well, is instantly memorable. With Times film writers, filmmakers and stars weighing in, we ranked the 25 jump scares that still get us every time. WARNINGThis article contains spoilers and may include intense scenes that could be disturbing for some readers.David Fincher and Andrew Kevin Walker on the Buildup in Seven When a rotting figure gasps for breath, the reaction of Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and John C. McGinley was so convincing, it spawned a modern myth: that they werent told the body was an actor, not a prop. As it turns out, the stars did know (sorry, internet!), but the fact that the myth persists is a testament to the potency of the scene. In an email, the director, David Fincher, credited the screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker: Andy wrote it  it was a great idea  so I filmed it. The police pull back a grimy sheet to reveal a decomposing body ... ... Brad Pitts detective isnt so sure what hes seeing ... ... and when John C. McGinleys SWAT leader leans over the body, they all get a shock. But in an interview, Walker insisted it was Fincher and the prosthetics and makeup master, Rob Bottin, who turned his vision into a grisly jump scare, one that shouldnt have worked because it was absolutely expected. It was so much more a build, an exciting and almost clichd action scene that kind of slowly turns, Walker said. Their goal was to take the audiences expectation of the cavalry riding in, then to get a buzz saw to the face.  Maya Salam Stream it hereJennifer Kent on the Soundscape in The Babadook A bedroom door slowing creaking open. The scuffling of what sounds like cockroaches. A gravelly voice uttering the dreaded Babadook, dook, dook. And Amelia, a mother whos mentally unraveling, trembling under a blanket. In The Babadook, directed by Jennifer Kent, the soundscape is both classic haunted house and modern nightmare. The scene was intended to mimic what anyone would feel lying in bed as footsteps approach. All the sound is sucked out of the moment, Kent said in an interview. Its like we become hyper-aware. I hoped to draw the audience in and have them become her. Kent didnt follow tradition and incorporate most sound in postproduction. What I tend to do is make sure that the sound is in there, enough temporary sound is in there to make sure all this visual stuff works, she explained. So its very important to rhythm. Cutting a film is much closer to music than many people probably realize.

He also grew up to write the novel Psycho, the source for the movie with a jump scare so effective it transformed, for many, the experience of taking a shower. Jump scares are considered the fart jokes of horror: cheap, easy and lowbrow. But that gives short shrift to a long, potent legacy. Of course, they can be crude, overdone and shoehorned in, but they can also be refined, mysterious and emotionally integrated. And as Chaney demonstrated a century ago, even the simplest ones have a power that should not be underestimated. The stakes are high because success is binary: A jump scare produces a jolt or it doesnt work. That puts a premium on novelty. You cant just place another figure in a rotating mirror and expect shudders. Its been done too many times. To really unsettle, you must subvert expectations, add misdirection, a wilder image, perhaps a disorienting sound cue. More ingenuity goes into certain jump scares than entire movies. Far from simple to pull off, a truly great one is a feat of pure cinema. Jump scares have an advantage online, where context shifts rapidly. They can not only work independently of the movie, but also sometimes find a more popular second life outside it. In recent years, a canon has emerged, picked apart and debated by fans yet inspiring to filmmakers. In a genre more crowded than ever, where every kind of abrupt shift of camera angle, music cue or creepy image seems to have been employed to find a new way to shock, jump scares have become increasingly elaborate. At their best, they are ambitious set pieces, operating like showstoppers in musicals. The director James Wan is a contemporary master of the art, and one of his most bravura examples is from The Conjuring (2013), a haunted house movie in which Lili Taylor is terrorized by a clapping sound in the cellar. Patiently established over several scenes, this ingeniously startling fright involves no special effects or monsters. Theres a bouncing ball, two hands and the oldest scare of all: fear of the dark. The result doesnt just judder nerves. Like the most thrilling art, it rattles you into seeing old things anew while reordering your sense of the possible.",

            "text": "Shohei Ohtani has been a superstar in Japan for more than a decade, but one day earlier this year, a Tokyo resident named Tatsuo Shinke noticed something different.Shinke, the CEO of Mint, a leading trading card store, had already watched as Ohtanis soaring popularity had fueled the Japanese collectibles industry, spiked Japanese television ratings for Major League Baseball, and pushed baseball news into every corner and crevice of the countrys vast media ecosystem.AdvertisementYet as Ohtani made history in his first season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming the first player in history to record 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases in one season, Shinke observed another data point: His mother, Emiko.At 73 years old, Emiko had never followed baseball. But because Ohtanis Dodgers games are aired live in the morning in Japan, and because he has become a daily fixture on the countrys popular morning variety shows  the equivalent of Good Morning America or Today  Emiko developed a new morning routine: She wakes up, eats breakfast, and then turns on Ohtani.Elderly people in Japan love Ohtani, Shinke said. Its my mother. And all my mothers friends. Shes retired already, so she has enough time to watch all the games in the morning.In the United States, the World Series between the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers is a matchup featuring the countrys two biggest cities and most high-profile franchises. The audience could surpass 20 million viewers per game for the first time since 2016.In Japan, it will likely be even bigger.In seven seasons in the majors, including six for the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani has lorded his talent over Major League Baseball in a manner previously thought impossible. For his trouble, he has captured two Most Valuable Player awards while dominating as a hitter and a pitcher. If he wins his third this November, as is expected, he will become the first full-time designated hitter to win the award, a role he was forced to play after injuring his elbow last season.At World Series Media Day on Thursday, no one was a bigger draw than Ohtani. (Katharine Lotze / Getty Images)In America, his performance earned him a $700 million contract  the largest in history  and stardom in a sport that increasingly trails its rivals in cultural capital. But back home in Japan, where baseball is the most popular sport, Ohtanis celebrity has reached stratospheric levels, akin to Michael Jordan or David Beckham, figures who transcended their field of play and whose fame turned them into international avatars for their home country.AdvertisementThere isnt a person in Japan who doesnt know who Ohtani is, I dont think, said Robert Whiting, an American author in Tokyo who has written about Japanese baseball since the 1970s.When the Dodgers defeated the Padres in Game 5 of the National League Division Series  a game that featured two Japanese starting pitchers  an estimated audience of 12.9 million Japanese viewers tuned in at 9 a.m. on a Saturday, at least 5.4 million more than watched in the U.S. When Ohtani chased 50-50 in September, his exploits often led the national nightly news and daytime wide shows, spaces that rarely mention sports. (The business newspaper Nikkei also ran a front-page story above the fold.) And when Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, spoke of Ohtani during a press conference in Tokyo earlier this season, he told reporters he wanted to speak not as an ambassador but as a kid from Chicago who watched Jordan rule the 1990s and transcend basketball.This is early on in Ohtani-sans career, Emanuel said, but theres no doubt that thats what he has right now.The sheer volume of wall-to-wall coverage has even surprised Whiting, who first moved to Tokyo in the 1960s and has authored books on baseball and Japanese culture. Japan has seen this story before, the obsession over conquering baseball heroes in the form of Hideo Nomo, Ichiro Suzuki and Hideki Matsui, who was World Series MVP for the Yankees in 2009. But perhaps not since Nomo in the 1990s, Whiting says, has a Japanese player embodied and lifted the national spirit.When Nomo debuted for the Dodgers in 1995  in the middle of a nasty trade dispute between the United States and Japan  Whiting recalled that Asahi Shimbun, one of the nations biggest newspapers, ran an editorial stating: In Hideo Nomo, the Japanese have produced a product that no one is complaining about. But whereas Nomo, Suzuki and later pitchers like Yu Darvish validated the quality of Japanese baseball, Ohtani has changed the equation: For the first time, Japanese fans can credibly argue that the most talented baseball player of all time is from Japan.AdvertisementIn the global market, Japanese value and power is (becoming) a little bit weaker, year by year, said Tomoki Negishi, a baseball marketing executive who worked for Japans Pacific League. So Ohtani-sans great performance is a beacon.To some, he says, Ohtani is a symbol of Japan in the global market.To others?He is just a crazy superhero that Ive never seen before, Negishi says.On the morning of October 12, the symbol beamed through a television into a living room in ta, a special ward in Tokyo. Masanori Ninomiya, an owner of an English reading company, finished a traditional breakfast of white rice, miso soup and fruit and then turned on the Dodgers and Padres.Ninomiya, 59, grew up in the city of Oita, obsessing over books about Japanese baseball history. He attended business school at UCLA in the 90s, as Nomo was breaking through. He is among those in Tokyo who work remotely, which allows him to put the Dodgers on in the background during the work week.Everybody will have a breakfast, he said And then its Ohtani.In Japan, all Dodgers games appear on NHK, the countrys free, over-the-air public broadcaster. The audience for NHK often skews older, especially in the mornings. Unlike the United States, where European soccer fans huddle in bars and pubs in the morning, there is less public consumption of Ohtani, outside of major events like the World Baseball Classic. According to Negishi, this is partly due to cultural norms and partly because of the sheer volume of baseball games.Im sure Im not the only one, said Chen Liang, director of imports at Mint cards and collectibles. But theres a huge percentage of Japanese people who are at work, and theyre in front of their computer, and theyre just clicking on the box score while they look at Excel sheets and things like that.AdvertisementNinomiya was awed by Ohtani when he emerged as a two-way player for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. He followed him when he debuted with the Angels in 2018, when the morning ritual began. But he ascribes the national love affair to the way Ohtani has conducted himself on the MLB stage.For example, if theres garbage on the ground, he tries to pick it up, Ninomiya said. We know hes a superstar  and super rich  but he doesnt behave like that.Ohtani and his representatives have cultivated an image in Japan of a modest, polite baseball star who is deferential to teammates and respectful to elders. The reputation helped Ohtani weather a wave of public scrutiny earlier this year, when his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was charged with stealing more than $16 million from an Ohtani bank account to cover gambling debts. (Mizuhara later pleaded guilty.) Its also helped him land a raft of endorsements from companies on both sides of the Pacific and turn his personal life into daily fodder on television. (His wife, Mamiko Tanaka, and his dog, translated to Dekopin in Japanese, are regular characters on the daytime shows.)The comings and goings of Mamiko Tanaka and Ohtani are regular fodder for Japanese morning shows. (Stringer / Getty Images)Those are traits that I think Japanese fans love to see in practice on a foreign land, said Hiroshi Kitamura, an associate professor of history at William & Mary who specializes in U.S.-East Asian relations. Japanese fans love to see MLB players like (Aaron) Judge, (Fernando) Tatis, (Ronald) Acuna say great things about Ohtani as being the unicorn. But I think they also appreciate seeing Ohtani kind of being Japanese. In that sense, I think Japanese fans see Ohtani as part of them.The face of Major League Baseball greeted Foster Griffin each day when he arrived in Tokyo. The billboards. The cardboard likenesses in convenience stores. Ohtanis voice even features in advertisements on the subway.Soon after Griffin, a former Kansas City Royals pitcher, moved to Japan to pitch for the Yomiuri Giants, he learned the cultural primacy of televised nightly news.And he has his own section of the news, Griffin said. They highlight everything he does every day over there. Hes everywhere.AdvertisementFrom an American perspective, its hard to conceive of the popularity of Ohtani in Japan. America does not revere any foreign sports in which they are not supreme. The Japanese media, a sprawling apparatus with five commercial television networks and five national daily newspapers, can be impenetrable for non-Japanese speakers. And contrary to hyperbole, not everyone in Japan cares about baseball.Culturally, I felt like in recent years, the interest of young kids seemed headed to new sports like soccer, said Ema Ryan Yamazaki, a Japanese filmmaker raised in Osaka.The sport, however, remains a cultural unifier, a source of connection at the office or during the morning commute. And Ohtani has transcended demographics, spawning new generations of fans while appealing to retired grandmothers in Tokyo, Fukuoka and Sapporo.In Japan, Ohtani is the face of countless advertising campaigns. (Tomohiro Ohsumi / Getty Images)The school teacher understands a balk and an intentional walk, throughout the entire country, said Bobby Valentine, the former Mets manager who had two stints in Japan as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines. Its like a port of passage. Baseball allows you to be acceptable in the culture. Its just one of those things.When Ohtani led the country to a World Baseball Classic championship last year, more than 42 percent of Japanese households watched Japan defeat the United States at 8 a.m on a Wednesday. Six of Japans seven WBC games drew more than 30 million viewers. Ohtanis presence  along with starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto  could help the Japanese World Series audience approach those heights. The numbers are already so striking that MLB continues to target the Japanese market, and will open the 2025 season with the Dodgers facing the Chicago Cubs in Tokyo, a year after the Dodgers opened the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres. Commissioner Rob Manfred told The Athletic this week that If youre going to open (the season) in Tokyo, the only choice was to take the Dodgers again. And the reason its the only choice is the audiences that those games deliver are so big that it drives whats a real broadcast business for us in Japan.The first pitch of the World Series will come at 9:08 a.m. on Saturday, airing on both NHK and commercial network Fuji TV. Interest is so high that creators of the wildly popular manga show One Piece pushed back a season premiere, to not compete with Ohtani.Smart move to move the show on their part, Yamazaki said. I would, too.AdvertisementAs Ninomaya puts it, the only figure in Japan who could conceivably surpass Ohtani in name recognition is the prime minister, and the current one, Shigeru Ishiba, just took office earlier this month.Some young people may not know our prime minister, he said. But even kids  junior high school students, senior high school students  everybody knows Ohtani.Yes, every generation in Japan is ready for breakfast with Ohtani. Even if there is one that appears most charmed.Earlier this year, Whiting, 82, was talking to his wife, Machiko Kondo, who worked for years as a resettlement officer at the United Nations. For decades, Kondo never expressed any interest in baseball, even as Whiting wrote best-selling books about Japanese baseball history and the meaning of Ichiro, even as he followed games on both sides of the Pacific.But then came Ohtani.Ive written all these baseball books that have gotten national attention, and it doesnt mean anything to her, Whiting said. But now with Ohtani, shes started asking: Did Ohtani have any home runs?The Athletics Andy McCullough and Sam Blum contributed to this story(Illustration: Dan Goldfarb / The Athletic; Photos: Jayne Kamin-Oncea / Getty Photos)",

            "text": "Let me apologize in advance for cheating a bit.We use the term breakout like its just spontaneous combustion, but thats rarely how it happens. Like most reactions, usually they require a catalyst. Thus, the inherent issue about calling a breakout in advance is that often the term isnt quite what were describing. Instead, the real breakout is one of opportunity, in the form of minutes and touches, rather than one of rapidly changing levels of play.AdvertisementFor example, check out last seasons Most Improved Player award winner, the Philadelphia 76ers Tyrese Maxey. Yes, he has made steady progress since his rookie year in 2020. But the big change for him last season wasnt about his own game; it was about the departure of James Harden days into the season. That transaction opened the door for Maxey to become Phillys primary on-ball initiator, increase his usage rate from 24.1 percent to 28.0 percent and up his scoring rate from 20.3 per game to 25.9.Youll find similar storylines littering the field when looking at my All-Breakout squad for this season, consisting of 11 players I think have a chance to significantly boost their production from a year ago.The Basketball 100 The story of the greatest players in NBA history. In 100 riveting profiles, top basketball writers justify their selections and uncover the history of the NBA in the process. The story of the greatest plays in NBA history. Pre-orderSo, back to the cheating  Ill also note that I cheated a second time since I already have 1/82 of the answers to the test. Its a little easier to come up with an All-Breakout Team when you already have a peek at how minutes and touches will work for most of these teams after a few days of games.That said, projecting breakouts can be a bit harder than it looks. Injuries, slumps and our misperceptions caused by our tiny human brains can easily send a potential breakout sideways. Take a gander at last seasons list, for instance.I had the Most Improved Player (Maxey), but none of the other 13 players who received votes made my list. I had Anthony Edwards, Chet Holmgren and Scottie Barnes on my team, all of whom genuinely broke out  but I also had LaMelo Ball and Mikal Bridges. And then theres Charlottes Mark Williams, who seemed like an easy call 12 months ago. He ended up playing 19 games.With that said, let me bravely charge ahead into my list for this year. I tried to represent every level of the playing spectrum, so along with a few players who are already big stars, I have some deep cuts in secondary roles.AdvertisementMy 11-man All-Breakout Team for 2024-25:This isnt just me riding the wave of Davis dominant opening night performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Hes low-key been on a heater for the last few months; Davis was one of the most productive players in preseason, even when most veterans throttle down to coasting speed, and was one of the best players on Team USAs gold-medal winning squad.Before that, he finished his 2023-24 regular season strong and was fantastic in the Lakers five-game, first-round defeat against the Denver Nuggets, averaging 27.8 points on 67 percent shooting and a playoff-leading 15.6 boards. Hes also, thankfully, playing full-time as a center, which is his most productive position even if he doesnt like it.Health and shooting will always be the swing variables for Davis, but hes off to a good start on those fronts as well  he even made an above-the-break 3 in the opener. The bar is high for a breakout here, but with 39-year-old LeBron James volume possibly on the downslope and few others capable of soaking up the extra chances, this could be a career year for Davis.GO DEEPER Anthony Davis gives Lakers an early dose of hope  and a long-awaited blueprintDyson Daniels, SG, AtlantaThis one isnt the usual case of a player breaking out because of an increase in touches and shots. This is a defensive breakout, where Daniels is being thrust into a role as the Hawks defensive stopper. He was a force at that end in New Orleans, but his role fluctuated because of a crowded backcourt and his iffy shooting, limiting him to 22 minutes per game across 61 appearances and just 17 total minutes in the playoffs.That wont be the case in Atlanta, where the Hawks have been desperate for an elite defender on the perimeter. The 6-foot-8, 21-year-old Daniels is starting and likely will see big minutes as along as his offense is at least somewhat threatening. If so, he has a great chance to lead the league in steals (he had five on opening night and was second in the NBA in steal rate a year ago) and a decent shot at cracking one of the All-Defensive teams.Zion Williamson, PF/C, New OrleansThis one is a pure eye-test call: Williamson finished last season playing the best basketball of his career. He was in the midst of destroying the Lakers in a Play-In game when his hamstring betrayed him. All that seems to have carried over to this year, where he looks fantastic in preseason  statistically, sure, but even more so physically, exploding past people as he did as a rookie and accumulating heaps of layups.AdvertisementAll of this is juiced by his expected positional move to center. Even if it isnt full-time, he should have enough reps at that spot that he can feast blowing past overmatched centers or compromising defenses as a rim-running screener if they try to match up smaller against him.Williamson missed the Pelicans opener with an illness, but that should be a quick absence. I dont know exactly how many games well see of this version of him, but Im excited about the possibility of seeing a full-ish season of peak Williamson. This feels like the season we might get it.GO DEEPER What's behind Zion Williamson's newfound drive? TrustAmen Thompson, positionless, HoustonBetween Wembymania and Thompsons early-season injury, the hype machine for the fourth pick in the 2023 draft never really got rolling. I think that might change this year, when Thompson has a greater chance to establish himself as a hybrid center-guard-not-sure-what-to-call-it dynamo who can blow up offenses with his switchy, twitchy athleticism and wreak havoc in transition at the other end.There are some barriers, as we saw on opening night. Thompson is coming off the bench, and his lack of shooting is exacerbated by a roster that already doesnt have much reliable spacing. He still has to become a more refined decision-maker to take advantage of his ballhandling and athleticism too. That said, Thompsons fine rookie season (18.2 PER, 57.6 percent true shooting, mammoth rebound and steal + block rates) largely went under the radar a season ago, and that doesnt figure to be the case this season on a Houston squad that should be a League Pass favorite.Josh Giddey, PG/SF, ChicagoGiddy only had a lukewarm opener against New Orleans feisty wing defenders, but Ill stay on the bandwagon here. He should fit in his role in Chicago much more easily than he did in Oklahoma City as an on-ball creator with limited shooting gravity. That should provide him more opportunity to grow in some of the other areas (drawing fouls, defense, catch-and-shoots, etc.), where his limitations dragged him down with the Thunder. Additionally, Chicagos situation should give Giddey a lot more opportunities to play through mistakes and develop on the floor.Not that hes chopped liver now. The 22-year-old is a plus passer and rebounder with an excellent floater game and good court vision, and for what its worth, hes also one of the best inbound passers in basketball. That hes also playing for a contract after he and the Bulls didnt reach an extension this past week is another reason to believe in him taking a big step up.GO DEEPER Why teams held the line at the extension deadline, and which clubs made out bestJalen Williams, SF, Oklahoma CityJust because its obvious doesnt mean it isnt true. The Thunder badly need a secondary shot creator to step up, especially with the aforementioned Giddey gone, and Williams is the clear candidate to soak up a lot of those touches and shots.Hes also shown the capability of being a player who can handle that added responsibility efficiently, as hes proven up to the challenge at each step of his development in his first two seasons with the Thunder. Again, its not just about the opportunity here, but about Williams having the talent to sustain a greater role on a winning team. For what its worth, Williams was awesome in his four preseason games, with a 30.1 PER on 66.3 percent true shooting.AdvertisementRJ Barrett, SF, TorontoIf a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears, it, does it makes a sound? What if, instead of a forest, its Canada?Barrett was already showing signs of turning a corner last season in New York, then played significantly better after the trade in Toronto. Nobody noticed because it happened in the general destitution of the Raptors 2023-24 season, but Barrett is becoming a dude.In 32 games as a Raptor, Barrett averaged 21.4 points per game and shot 60.5 percent on 2s. The eye test backed it up; there was more comfort and control in the finishing, more nuanced shot selection and distribution and even (gasp) the occasional right-handed attack.He built on that in the summer by arguably being Canadas second-best Olympian, averaging 19.8 points on blistering 70.1 percent true shooting. While we didnt see him in preseason due to a sprained AC joint, hes listed as day-to-day and expected to rejoin the action soon, so it shouldnt slow him down too much.Entering his age-24 season, on a roster with basically four real players and some serious question marks, Barrett should have plenty of room to explore his limits and continue refining his hard-charging downhill game.Tre Mann makes a move against Miles McBride and the Knicks. (John Jones / USA Today Network via Imagn Images)Tre Mann, SG, CharlotteMann is single-handedly trying to bring baggy back. Seeing him on the court in his 178-pound frame and size XXXXL jersey and shorts, it looks like one of those in-game promotions where they have kids put on an NBA players uniform then run around and try to score a basket.Mann, however, is pretty good at the latter part. He scored 24 points in Charlottes upset of Houston on opening night, continuing a positive stretch of basketball dating to his trade from the Thunder last spring. Mann was one of the leagues most effective players statistically in preseason, which does have some predictive value, and quietly averaged double figures in 28 games for the Hornets at the end of last season.AdvertisementThis was a bit of a surprise, as he had struggled to gain traction for three years in Oklahoma City, and its possible his lack of size for a two guard and limited playmaking for a point guard restrict him going forward. As with Giddey above, theres also a financial incentive. The Hornets could have extended Mann this past week (hes on the last year of his rookie deal) and instead opted to wait and gather more information.Julian Strawther, SF, DenverIm not even cheating on this one because the Nuggets hadnt played yet when I wrote this. But Strawther seems to be at the right nexus of opportunity and production. He was eighth in the NBA in preseason scoring, and the Nuggets desperately need him to fill a void in the wing rotation created by Kentavious Caldwell-Popes departure. He also has the specific skill set they most crave, as a high-volume 3-point shooter on a team that was last in 3-point rate a year ago.Strawthers rookie season with the Nuggets was mostly spent watching, and his NBA minutes didnt go all that well with an 8.2 PER and 29.7 percent 3-point shooting. However, the 22-year-old from Gonzaga has thrived in other settings  hes had two strong summer leagues in addition to his 2024 preseason  and small-sample shooting variance explains much of his poor stats from 2023-24.Cam Thomas green light, BrooklynIm not sure whether this qualifies as a genuine breakout or just something thats going to be fun as hell to watch. But if were talking about touches and opportunity? Sheesh. Thomas had 36 points on 27 shots opening night in Atlanta, and if you look at the Nets roster, that trend line seems likely to continue. Theres just nobody else on the team who can create shot volume like Thomas, and the volume will only increase if Brooklyn moves Dennis Schrders expiring contract.Thomas has always been a high-volume player, ranking sixth in the league in field goal frequency a year ago. However, the criticism was about quality, not quantity. In the past, there have been too many tough 2-point jumpers and little in the way of playmaking, both of which dragged down his efficiency. Thomas corrected some of that in the opener, getting off 13 3-point attempts and making seven, and interjecting at least a couple of passing reads that let you talk yourself into growth there.After 48 hours, he was third in the NBA in field goal attempts and second in scoring. With few other options on the Nets roster and operating in a contract year, Thomas may stay near the top of both columns all season.This isnt quite on Thomas level, but Powell is in a contract year and looks set to re-establish at least some of his value on a Clippers team that really needs his scoring. Or maybe, as a Cheers fan, I just like to yell out Norm! occasionally.AdvertisementEither way, Powell will be the second option next to James Harden for as long as Kawhi Leonard is out. When Leonard returns, Powell will likely revert to a sixth man role. A 17-point, four-assist opener in Phoenix is a good start for this trend line, and Powell did this while going 1 of 7 from 3 (hes a 39.4 percent career shooter from distance).Powell has the added benefit of no longer having to watch the Russell Westbrook show when he checks in with the Clippers subs. Instead, with Leonard injured and Paul George departed, it mostly will be his show any time Harden is off the floor. While Powell thrives best as a secondary scorer rather than a get-out-of-my-way guy, hell also have significant overlap with Harden where he can thrive off the ball. At age 31, he could end up threatening his career-high scoring average of 19.6 from back in Toronto.Sign up to get The Bounce, the essential NBA newsletter from Zach Harper and The Athletic staff, delivered free to your inbox.(Photo of Anthony Davis and Zion Williamson: Tyler Kaufman / Getty Images)",

Hes already awake, driving through the predawn darkness, pulling into an empty parking lot at 21300 Coach Gibbs Dr. The routine he started his final year at LSU has become a staple of his rookie season in the NFL.AdvertisementYou always here this early? Adam Peters asked after bumping into Daniels in the hallway around 5:30 a.m. a few weeks ago. Peters, the Commanders first-year general manager, was headed to the weight room. Daniels was about to watch some film.Usually, its a little earlier, Daniels told him. But I had to make an extra stop today.Peters looked down. Daniels was holding two boxes of donuts, gifts for his offensive linemen.For a while, his teammates didnt know he was showing up so early; Daniels studies with the door shut and doesnt tell anyone hes there. But in time, the car that kept beating them to the building, day after day, week after week, started to tell them something. A few started to wonder: is it normal for a quarterback to show up this early?Not normal for most, says linebacker Bobby Wagner, a 13-year veteran bound for the Hall of Fame. Normal for the great ones.After Washington took Daniels second in Aprils draft, the teams new center, Tyler Biadasz, figured hed start coming in early to work with the rookie on exchanges. He showed up at 6 one morning and realized he was late. Daniels was already on the practice field, repping that days walkthrough. Alone.GO DEEPER Jayden Daniels' growth with VR simulation has Commanders embracing mind gamesTerry McLaurin knew after his first practice. Daniels hadnt been on the field 15 minutes  hadnt been in the building a week  and he was already making checks at the line of scrimmage. Then the rookie made a throw that cut through the teeth of the defense, a throw McLaurin remembers in detail five months later.Heres why this play is different, the sixth-year Pro Bowl wideout says. The receivers running a crosser, and most guys wait to release it until he clears the hook defender in the middle of the field. They wait until that window opens up, you know?Jayden threw it before there even was a window. Ive never seen a rookie do that.AdvertisementLinebacker Frankie Luvu was on the field that day. He saw the throw. He knew, too.We gotta get our s right on defense, he told himself, because we got ourselves a quarterback.A quarterback? This team? After churning through 27 starters and 10 coaches during the Dan Snyder era  winning just two playoff games in 24 years  as one of the NFLs proud franchises dissolved into dysfunction?There were league investigations and Congressional hearings. Leaked emails. The name change. The railing collapse. RGIIIs knee. Cover-ups. Lawsuits. And losing. Years and years of losing.Ive seen this place from afar, and there was always this black cloud over it, says Washington tight end Zach Ertz, who spent eight-plus years beating up on the franchise as a member of the Philadelphia Eagles. This was an organization that always had talent, but you were never worried about them long-term.With new leadership, a guy like Jayden, the right group around him  this city has waited for this.Still, this is a scarred franchise and a scarred fan base trying to shake that lingering fear thats been beaten into them for 30 years.Paul Walker is 65. Hes wearing a burgundy Sonny Jurgensen No. 9, tailgating ahead of the Commanders Week 7 meeting with the Panthers. My first game in person since the Monday Night Massacre, he says, referring to the night 14 years ago when Eagles quarterback Michael Vick torched Washington for six touchdowns in a 59-28 win. We always got that mentality that somethings eventually gonna go wrong. It just always has.But Im telling you, this season is bringing me back to the Joe Gibbs years. Our quarterback might be the best one weve had since Walker pauses, then points to his chest, to Jurgensens No. 9.Rob Abelman fell in love with football during the Gibbs years. He used to tag along with his dad to games at RFK Stadium, and he watched two Super Bowl wins in person. Then he got so fed up with the team during Snyders run that he canceled his season tickets.AdvertisementThe minute he read Snyder was selling the team, he signed up for new ones. I have the belief because Ive seen it, says Abelman, who with his son, Jared, drives in from Philadelphia for games. (Jared) doesnt. Hes 24. All hes known his whole life is heartbreak.Sunday spoke to both. A 40-7 romp over Carolina  the NFC East-leading Commanders fifth win in six weeks  was tinged by Daniels first-quarter exit. Its a rib injury, not expected to be anything serious, but a reminder nonetheless for a fan base trying to convince itself its allowed to believe again.Hope remains a dangerous thing in the District.It started with an arena league quarterback drilling his dropbacks on an empty field just west of the San Bernardino Mountains. Ryan Porter was mid-sweat when Jay Daniels walked out of the YMCA across the street, recognized him, and asked if hed ever considered coaching. Porter shook his head.But I guess I could, he finally said.Cool, well be here tomorrow, Jay told him. I have a son who plays quarterback.By that point, Jay had pushed his 12-year-old to think about a different position. Jayden was long and lean, always the fastest kid on the field. What about wide receiver? dad would ask. Or cornerback? Jay had played the latter in college, first at Washington, then Iowa State, and to him it was merely a numbers game. Way more opportunities to get on the field, hed argue.The conversation kept coming up. The two kept going back and forth.Dad, Jayden always shot back, Im a quarterback.He was hell-bent, his father says now.So it was settled. Jay wouldnt fight his sons ambitions; hed nurture them.The first thing he did was warn Jayden. Youre gonna have to live in chaos, dad said. If you can live in chaos, then you can do this. Theyd spend hours on YouTube, poring through old games, studying some of the best to ever play the position. Jay wanted his son watching Joe Montana, because Joe Montana never lost his cool. Look at his face, hed tell Jayden. His expression never changes.AdvertisementA hard lesson came early, and it stuck: Jayden was 7, playing defense in the Pop Warner championship, and he was beat around the edge for a touchdown. He looked up at his father, about to burst into tears. Dont cry, Jay pleaded. Its just one play.He knew if the teams best player lost it, everyone else would, too. The tears spilled out. The whole team followed. The game was never close after that, Jay says.That afternoon  and what it taught Jayden  has stayed with him ever since. He built an unflappability into his game, refusing to get rattled. He knows teammates are watching, and teammates will follow.Seven games into his career, Jayden Daniels leads the NFL in completion percentage (75.6) and ranks sixth in passer rating (107.0). (Patrick Smith / Getty Images)Jay had always been a football junkie; his son became one too. Theyd watch college games on Saturdays and the NFL on Sundays. Theyd watch day after day of the scouting combine, then the entire NFL Draft. Porter, who would work with Jayden through high school, learned something early on: this wasnt just a hobby, and it wasnt just a sport.I call it an unhealthy obsession, the coach says. Not one time did Jayden ask, Hey, are my two hours up? He was there to get better. He was never bored. He was just in love with this thing called quarterback.Jay would send over videos from Jaydens U-14 games. OK, we got the zone read and RPO bubble down, hed write. Whats next? Porter realized he could teach Jayden a drill and never have to repeat himself. Hed see a nod, hear Mmmhmmm and nothing more.During workouts, Porter worked the feet more than he worked the arm. The smooth dropbacks Jayden employs now in burgundy and gold  the big five, rhythm five, flash give, seven step, one-step bounce  were first honed on that empty field across from the San Bernardino YMCA. Jayden saw progress through thousands of reps.Your eyes control your feet, and your feet control your arm, Porter kept telling him. He never once tinkered with Jaydens mechanics. He saw no need. Its like a slingshot, Porter says. Throwing a football for somebody like Jayden Daniels is a very natural thing. The minute I make it unnatural, Ive failed him as a coach.AdvertisementJaydens talents blossomed at Cajon High in San Bernardino, where his parents had to sign a waiver to allow him to play varsity as a freshman. He was maybe 130 pounds, Jay says. The Cowboys were state champs three years later. From there the spotlight began to swell, just as Jay had warned, and Jayden wrestled with the rigors of being a star quarterback. The pressure mounted his senior year: Everyone wanted five touchdowns a game, another state title, and, most of all, his college decision.Jay saw it on his sons face at halftime of Cajons playoff opener that fall. Jayden was playing lousy. He looked overwhelmed. Walking into the locker room, coaches kept pulling him aside, pointing out mistakes. The weight of it all, the hype, the expectations  he was a 17-year-old kid shouldering too much.Say something to him, Jay told Porter, who by that point was an assistant at Cajon.So while Jayden warmed up before the third quarter, Porter pulled out his phone and showed him a picture. In it, Jayden was 12 years old, smiling ear to ear, doing his favorite thing in the world: playing football. Forget all this BS right now, Porter told him. I just need you to be this kid.While Jayden stared at the photo, a tear trickled down his cheek. He threw three touchdowns after halftime. Cajon won 39-7 and made its way back to the state title game.While he weighed where to transfer after three years at Arizona State, Jayden Daniels told his dad, If I cant make it at LSU, then I dont deserve to be in the NFL one day. (Scott Winters / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Three years later, another decision beckoned: after a sterling start at Arizona State, Daniels struggled as a junior, tossing as many interceptions (10) as touchdowns. What few knew at the time: how much heartache hed been forced to bottle up inside.The winter before, in a span of three weeks, he lost two grandparents to COVID-19. His grandfathers passing hit hardest: Jays dad had passed football down to him, and Jay had passed it down to Jayden. Jayden and his grandfather had spoken the night before. I love you, his grandpa told him. Itd be the last thing Jayden ever heard him say.AdvertisementMan, that took a toll on both of us, his father says now. He carried a heavy load that season.Meanwhile, the NCAA was digging into ASUs program for alleged recruiting violations. Herm Edwards, the former NFL coach Daniels had come to Tempe to play for, was on his way out. The quarterback sought a bigger stage to finish his college career and an offense better suited to his strengths. He decided to transfer. His phone started blowing up.Daniels decided he wouldnt demand the starting job at his next stop, and his top choice, LSU, wasnt offering it. Hed arrive as the fourth QB on the depth chart.Jay stepped aside and let his son make the decision.High risk, high reward, Jayden told him. If I cant make it at LSU, then I dont deserve to be in the NFL one day.Youre gonna hate me, Sherman Wilson texted him.It was December 2022. Daniels had decided to return to LSU for his fifth and final college season, and Wilson, the Tigers director of player retention, wanted him to know what the next few months were going to look like.Wilson had been goading the quarterback for weeks while he weighed entering the draft. If you wanna be a fourth-round pick, fine, Wilson wrote at one point. But you have more to do here.Once Daniels decided to stay, Wilson became his corner man, Bundini Brown in his ear. Instead of shouting at him ringside, Wilson texted incessantly. Bible verses. Motivational stories. Barbs to seep under Daniels skin. Wilson knew he hadnt come close to reaching his potential in Baton Rouge.You succeed in September by preparing in January, Wilson wrote.Dont act like you wanna be the best if youre not willing to do what others arent.I hope youre ready, because youre not gonna see your family after spring break.For Daniels, everything changed. Hed think like a pro, study like a pro, work like a pro. The first thing he did was sit down with LSUs coaching staff and tick through a series of questions he wanted answered. Among them: Whats the detailed plan of how were going to win a national championship? And: What do I need to do to turn myself into a first-round pick?AdvertisementThe coaches looked around the room. They already had Daniels next few months mapped out, but for the quarterback to show this type of initiative? They knew what was coming. They knew he was about to take over.He put everything into that offseason, says Joe Sloan, LSUs QB coach at the time.A nutritionist cooked Daniels meals and helped him pack on 15 pounds. He started nightly throwing sessions with his top two receivers, Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr., that would last until 10 p.m. In the mornings, Daniels and Wilson would race to the building for 5 a.m. film sessions. Eventually, the quarterback started showing up so early they had to change the keycodes on the door.By the fall he was the best player in college football.Then, one night in November, his season nearly slipped away. A nasty hit knocked Daniels out of the Tigers road loss to Alabama. Im shaking it off! he shouted at Wilson in the medical tent. I gotta finish this! But the staff wouldnt let him. One play, and one concussion, threatened to upend his pursuit of the Heisman Trophy.He texted Wilson around 4 a.m. Theyll probably give it to him, Daniels wrote, referring to Washington QB Michael Penix Jr., Daniels chief competition for the award.Sounds like youre quitting, Wilson wrote back, tapping into Daniels competitive juices.Im not quitting. Just stating the obvious.If youre gonna pack it in, fine.F that, Daniels wrote.The two were in the film room at 5 a.m. on Monday. This is the week thatll define your career, Wilson told him.Daniels couldnt drive, so Wilson picked him up. Daniels was still in concussion protocol, so Wilson used his own fingerprint to get them in the building. The QB watched film of Floridas defense with sunglasses on, his hoodie pulled tight and the door shut. Nobody knew we were there, Wilson says. Daniels barely practiced that week but cleared protocol in time to start.Turns out, the Heisman race wasnt over. Daniels lit up the Gators for 606 all-purpose yards and five touchdowns in a 53-35 rout. A month later he stood on stage in New York City, trophy in hand.Daniels thought his chance at the Heisman disappeared after he was knocked out of a loss to Alabama late in the season. (Rich Graessle / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)On draft night four months later, Daniels waited one pick to hear his name called. Hed been No. 1 on Washingtons board all along, ahead of Caleb Williams, who went first to the Bears. You put in all the work in the early mornings, the late nights, Peters told him over the phone. I couldnt be more proud to pick you to represent our franchise.AdvertisementThen Peters handed the phone over to Dan Quinn. The coach was more direct: Were gonna kick a lot of ass together.Wilson texted a few days later, wanting Daniels thoughts on his new team.Were going to the playoffs, Daniels wrote back.Wilson shook his head  the kid was nothing if not ambitious. But this wasnt college football. The rookie needed to temper his expectations. Brother, this is the NFL, Wilson wrote. This is different.Daniels wouldnt budge.No, listen to me, he replied. Were going to the playoffs.They meet at 9 a.m. every Saturday, an hour before the rest of the team has to be in the building. Inside the room, its just the quarterbacks and skill position players. The 23-year-old rookie stands at the front, running through the 10 or 12 scripted plays the offense plans to open the game with a day later. Daniels reminds them of the audibles he can check into and the coverage beaters hell be looking for.Weve never had meetings like that here, McLaurin says. Not since Ive been here.Kliff Kingsbury, Washingtons first-year offensive coordinator, designed his system around Daniels dual-threat ability  The way he runs, it takes the soul of your defense, Peters gushed on draft night  without putting too much on the rookies shoulders. A heavy dose of short, timing-based throws are mixed in with a stout run game and the occasional deep shot, a healthy balance the young passer can manage. Seven games in, the Commanders are third in scoring (30.1 points per game) and Daniels leads the league in completion percentage (75.6).Marcus Mariota, Daniels backup, says the discipline of his decision-making is rare for a rookie, especially one drafted this high. There are certain expectations that greet a first-round quarterback the minute he walks through the door, expectations Mariota  the No. 2 pick in 2015  knows well. Too many chase highlight plays, Mariota says, the ones they built their name on in college.AdvertisementSo many times young guys in this league are trying to impress people, he says. They wanna extend plays and live up to their draft spot. Jaydens very much, Ill take what you give me. And if you give me the big one, Ill take that, too.'Sloan, now LSUs offensive coordinator, has followed Daniels rookie season closely. Nothings surprised him. He cant help but laugh when he thinks back to the question he kept getting from NFL evaluators last spring. They all wanted to know if Jayden Daniels was ready to be a pro.Listen, Sloan kept telling them, hes already a pro.(Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images)",

Kent Nishimura/Getty ImagesThat is who Donald Trump is, but that is not who we are.If there is one line to take away from Kamala Harriss Tuesday night speech, not far from the White House, that seems like a good choice. With it, the vice president sought to remind us of the chaos and confusion that cling to the former president like slime on a shoe, while expressing the hope that Americans still have faith in themselves, and in one another, to demand better.That, more than anything, is what Harris was selling in her closing argument to that curious collection of voters still on the fence in this presidential race: A way to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the chaos and the division of Trumpism.As high-stakes speeches go, this one was solidly constructed and solidly delivered. Harris isnt an Obama-level orator, whether were talking Barack or Michelle. She acknowledged that many voters still dont feel that they know her well, and this appearance most likely didnt help much with that. It was loaded with platitudes and with sentimentality that wasnt quite personal enough to be moving or illuminating: Raised in a middle-class family. Instinct to protect the little guy. Always listen to you. Always tell you the truth. Never stop fighting for you. Build consensus. We need to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms? Oof.Once she got rolling, though, Harris did spend some time drawing distinctions between what she would do and what Trump would do, including: On Day 1, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list. A little cheesy? Sure. But totally accurate, and the presence of the Oval Office right over her shoulder made it real.She then ran through her plans to help make homeownership more accessible, to fight for an expanded child tax credit, to invest in the caregiving economy  complete with a nice shout out to the struggling sandwich generation. In discussing immigration, she mentioned border security first thing. She vowed to fight for the reproductive rights stripped away by Trumps handpicked Supreme Court justices, and she talked up the need for a strong military.This reads like a down-to-earth, bread-and-butter to-do list  with a little something for everyone, and a little something for everyone to hate. Did she dig into the specifics of any of her proposals? No, she did not. This was neither the time nor the place.Harriss top job was to remind everyone what is at stake in this election. Of course, more than perhaps anything she said, her choice of setting drove that point home: the Ellipse at the south end of Presidents Park, the very place where the Jan. 6 riot took form as Trump whipped his supporters into a frenzy before unleashing them on the Capitol.Say this about the Trump era, it has taught everyone the value of political theater.It doesnt have to be this way, Harris reminded us.In another week, well see if shes right.",

            "text": "Brock Purdy ate one at his locker before the Super Bowl. Andy Reid once offered them to his players as a reward. Before practice, during training camp and in the halftime locker room, they are a favorite of players across the NFL, a touch of childhood wrapped in plastic.A few years ago The Athletic wrote about orange slices, the NFLs secret halftime snack (fun fact: teams are required to provide three dozen sliced oranges for halftime for the visiting team). But in the course of reporting that story, many players said they passed on halftime citrus in favor of something else: Uncrustables, the sealed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches found in the frozen aisle of your local supermarket  and apparently permeating the NFL.AdvertisementAt the end of the 2023 season, The Athletic endeavored to find out just how many Uncrustables the league actually eats. And after convincing team employees that this was in fact a real question and not another scam message, most teams agreed to pony up their data from last year. A handful declined to participate, and a few others said they were PB&J purists who made their own sandwiches.But based on the information collected, its safe to say that NFL teams go through anywhere from 3,600 to 4,300 Uncrustables a week. When you factor in training camps and the teams that did not share their data, NFL teams easily go through at least 80,000 Uncrustables a year.Weekly Uncrustable consumption across the NFL DEN 700 SEA 320 JAX 315 MIA 300 ATL 250 NYG 240 PIT 225 ARI 200 MIN 200 LAC 200 BAL 150 WAS 140 CLE 120 CAR 100 TEN 100 CHI 100 IND 90 LAR 90 KC 80 DAL 75 TB 70 LV 60 CIN 50 NO 50 Note: 24 of 32 NFL teams provided The Athletic with approximate ranges for weekly Uncrustables eaten. The graphic represents the highest amount each team eats in a week. = 10Len Kretchman, a former wide receiver at North Dakota State, lived in the small town of Fergus Falls, Minn., and worked with schools in the food service industry. Sometime in the mid-90s, Len said, his wife, Emily, suggested he create a mass-produced peanut butter and jelly sandwich without the crust.The project appealed to Lens business instinct: a simple idea with a complex logistical problem to solve. The Kretchmans started in their kitchen with a loaf of bread, one jar of peanut butter, one jar of jelly and a few drinks.Were not recreating the atomic bomb here, Len said. Were trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  It was two people standing there, goofing off, probably having a beer and a glass of wine and saying, What do you think of this?'The first decision they made was that the sandwich should be round.The moon is round, the sun is round, the Earth is round, its our favorite shape, Len said. Do you have to go to a committee and survey people on what the shape should be? No. Its round. So we got that nailed down.Secrets behind the NFLs favorite sandwich Kitchen-counter to mass production Founder Len Kretchmans wife, Emily, suggested commercializing the snack, which got its iconic round shape from initially being cut out using a drinking glass. Innovative technique Putting the jelly in the middle and covering it with the peanut butter turned out to be the key to protecting the jelly from leaking. Whats in a name? The original name of the product, The Incredible Uncrustable, was coined by an 11-year-old boy whose father was involved in the business.Next, he grabbed a cup from his kitchen cabinet.If you asked moms how they (took the crust off a sandwich) 30 years ago, theyd say: I found a glass in my cupboard that was the right dimension and I pressed on the bread and I cut the crust off,' Kretchman said. And thats what we did!They added a crimp to the edges of the crustless bread, which was easy, but then had to figure out how to keep the jelly from oozing, which was not. Every time they thawed their creations, the jelly bled into the bread and ruined the sandwich. Much trial and error followed.We finally put the blob of jelly in the middle of the bread and then covered it with peanut butter and encased the jelly so it doesnt leach into the bread, Kretchman said. That was key. That was our gee-whiz moment.Were not recreating the atomic bomb here... were trying to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Len Kretchman, Co-inventor of UncrustablesKretchman and his business partner, David Geske, pitched their product to local schools. They needed a name. Once again, the idea landed in their kitchen. They asked the 11-year-old son of a business associate for a suggestion. His answer: The Incredible Uncrustable. Four years later, in 1999, Smuckers bought the company, dropped the first part of the name and introduced the country to the Uncrustable.It took a little time, but the NFL wasnt far behind.The Uncrustables eaten by the NFL in one year would cover over 18 yards of a football fieldThey werent there when former Pro Bowl tight end Dallas Clark was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in 2003. Of that much hes certain. But the moment this new treat joined the food ranks with all that other healthy crap the Colts provided? He cant really say.All that he remembers is the feeling that something beautiful had happened.AdvertisementIts up there with the cell phone where youre like, How is this done?' Clark said. When they came out it was like, Duh, why did someone not think of this a looong time ago?'It was Jon Torines job to stock those snacks, healthy crap and all, for the Colts. And it was an especially important job during the week of the Super Bowl in 2007 when the Colts played the Chicago Bears in Miami. In the hotel ballroom where the team stayed, Torine, the Colts strength and conditioning coach at the time, laid out a spread for players to grab and go as they moved from meeting to meeting.You could throw your playbook on top of em, didnt make any difference. Squished, unsquished, youre gonna crush it. Jeff Saturday, former Colts centerWe were all scoopin and scorin, said Jeff Saturday, a center on that team. We were grabbing five, six at a time.Clark, a player who struggled to keep on weight, would throw them in his backpack, unbothered by what would happen to them once there. The Uncrustables always found their way to the bottom and got smashed by the playbook, he said. But still edible. Still in one compartment.Didnt matter, Saturday said. You could throw your playbook on top of em, didnt make any difference. Squished, unsquished, youre gonna crush it.They are now a staple for many NFL teams. San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle eats two on flights to road games and anywhere from two to four on flights home. Chiefs defensive end Mike Danna eats them at the team facility and at home. Ravens kicker Justin Tucker grabs one from the snack table on his way to meetings. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce claimed on his podcast that he eats more of them than anything else in the world.Were all creatures of habit, dude, Saturday said. Almost freakishly. If youre a two-Uncrustables-a-day kind of guy, thats just what you do.Each week, the NFL consumes nearly the weight of three Travis Kelces in UncrustablesTorine and most nutritionists wouldnt recommend frozen, processed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as their No. 1 healthy snack option for players. But Uncrustables can do the job, especially when time is limited, and even nutritionists at the highest level of sports performance make compromises.AdvertisementThe bread and jelly give players quick carbohydrates. The peanut butter provides a little fat and a little protein. Theyre easy to digest, convenient to eat and a comfort food that players love (though there is wide disagreement as to whether grape or strawberry is the better jelly flavor  the correct answer is strawberry).In fact, the Colts also ate Uncrustables at halftime of Super Bowl XLI, when they beat the Bears 29-17.So maybe that was the difference, Torine said, laughing.",

            "text": "What does it really mean to live in a country where abortion is no longer a constitutional right? Since 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, many states have made it all but impossible to get abortion care within their borders, and have done their best to isolate people facing unwanted or complicated pregnancies, making them afraid to reach out to medical providers or even to friends and loved ones who might help them. New laws have forced doctors to delay care in life-threatening situations and made women afraid to seek it, leading to preventable deaths. Did anyone really want this?Even when the consequences havent been that dire, the day-to-day reality of abortion in Americas left-behind places now involves navigating constant undercurrents of confusion and fear: Is this pill I found on the internet safe? If I miscarry, is anyone going to help me? Or, in the cases of some doctors: How can I help this patient without getting arrested?We asked people at the front lines of abortion access to help us understand how the new laws have filtered into their worlds. They answered our call with texts, audio messages, videos and pictures; some shared their stories anonymously out of fear of reprisal. Taken as a whole, their dispatches show us an untenable status quo, held together by sheer grit and determination. But for how much longer?This presidential election will be the first since the Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization, when voters will be presented with a choice: to try to rein in the chaos unleashed by the ruling or to live in a country that continues to be shaped by it.",

            "text": "Sue Altman speaking with voters after a candidate forum held by Jewish organizations in New Jersey. A Democrat, she is running against Representative Thomas Kean Jr., a first-term Republican.Sue Altman has made a name for herself by taking on political heavy hitters in New Jersey.First was Chris Christie, the famously pugnacious Republican governor, who, during a 2016 town hall, was so exasperated by her questions about education funding that he tossed his microphone to her.Three years later, she tangled with George Norcross III, then among the states most influential Democratic power brokers, as she led a drumbeat of criticism against corporate tax breaks awarded to companies with close ties to him.Now Ms. Altman is seeking to unseat Thomas Kean Jr., a first-term Republican congressman who is the scion and namesake of a former governor, in one of a handful of races nationwide that will determine whether Republicans retain control of the House.The result of Tuesdays election in New Jerseys Seventh Congressional District may say a lot about how Mr. Kean, 56, has campaigned in the race, where recent polls have prompted Democrats to mount a last-minute push in hopes of flipping the seat.Image Mr. Kean, a son of a former Republican governor, was elected to the House two years ago. Credit... Bryan Anselm for The New York TimesBut it also may offer insight into the direction of New Jersey and of suburban swing districts like the Seventh, an affluent and well-educated region split nearly evenly between Republicans and Democrats. President Biden beat Donald J. Trump there by four points in 2020, but two years later Mr. Kean beat the Democratic incumbent, Tom Malinowski, by about three points.Ben Dworkin, director of Rowan Universitys Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship, said he saw the election mainly as a referendum on the hold that Mr. Trump has on the moderate wing of the Republican Party.If Democrats are able to win in NJ-7, Professor Dworkin said, then it will really show the negative impact that Donald Trump had on Republican candidates down ballot.Republican PACs have poured millions of dollars into the race. Voters in some parts of the North Jersey district, which stretches from the states border with Pennsylvania through quaint towns filled with horse farms to the eastern cities of Rahway and Linden, say their mailboxes fill regularly with Kean campaign literature.According to polls, Mr. Kean is ahead by about two points against Ms. Altman, a former teacher and professional basketball player who until last year ran the Working Families alliance, a left-leaning political organizing group.The campaign arm of House Democrats committed to spending about $4 million just last week  its first financial commitment in the race  after surveys showed that the contest was narrowing. Democratic Party luminaries like Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a leader of the congressional progressive PAC, and Bill Bradley, a former U.S. senator and New York Knicks star, have joined Ms. Altman, 42, on the campaign trail.At a candidate forum last week, the races high stakes and the potency of abortion rights as a political issue were on display.Mr. Kean described Ms. Altmans support for abortion access as abortion on demand, the same terminology he used two years ago in his successful campaign against Mr. Malinowski.Ms. Altman supports abortion access and a New Jersey law that codified the right to the procedure throughout a pregnancy.Mr. Kean, who has endorsed Mr. Trump, describes himself as pro-choice and said he would oppose a national ban on abortion. But he has also said that abortion policy was best handled at the state level when asked about the Supreme Courts decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which ended a constitutional right to abortion.During the forum, Mr. Kean, who opposed funding for Planned Parenthood while in the State Legislature, twice referred to doctors who commit abortion. When asked about the phrasing, which could be interpreted as condemning doctors who perform abortions, he said he had misspoken.Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in New Jersey by 917,000 voters.But that is not the case in the Seventh Congressional District, where the G.O.P. has more support and people who are not registered with either major party represent the largest bloc of voters. The district is filled with fiscally conservative residents who also support moderate social policies and who helped to propel Republicans like Mr. Christie; Mr. Keans father, Gov. Thomas Kean Sr.; and Christine Todd Whitman to the states highest office.A Monmouth University poll that put Mr. Kean ahead by two percentage points also found that more voters trusted him to handle issues related to the economy and crime. That edge was dwarfed, however, by Ms. Altmans advantage when voters were asked about abortion and reproductive health policy.Mr. Kean and his campaign have emphasized the brand of liberal politics that Ms. Altman stood for while leading Working Families, one of the states most progressive organizations. He has also highlighted a comment she made in 2020 on social media that referred to those of us working on #DefundThePolice in Jersey.She has apologized for that sentiment and disavowed it, saying she has since gained a better understanding of policing from officers and family members who worked for police agencies.But it is an issue that has resonated. At a town-hall meeting Ms. Altman held in Phillipsburg, on the states western flank, a member of the audience, Vinny Panico, challenged her position on policing.We have people breaking into houses, rummaging through peoples personal belongings to find their car keys to steal their cars, Mr. Panico, 33, a Republican, said in a subsequent interview, referring to a yearslong uptick in car thefts. Our police departments, and our men and women in blue, and our justice system, need support.Like Mr. Kean, Ms. Altman has worked to appeal to centrist voters, or, as she describes them, moderate people who are witnessing their beloved Republican Party dwindling down to this extremist morass.She grew up in the district, regularly mentions that her parents are Republicans, and in stump speeches stresses her background as an anti-corruption advocate with a record of opposing Democratic as well as Republican leaders.Both candidates are highly educated and each has raised more than $5 million in campaign contributions. Ms. Altman has two masters degrees from Oxford; Mr. Kean has a masters from Tufts and completed his doctoral studies there.But the comparisons end there.Mr. Kean is an awkward public speaker, holds few events open broadly to the public and avoids most media requests for interviews.Ms. Altmans energy and candor are among the first things people note after listening to her speak.To me, shes like a breath of fresh air, Melissa Lipman, 78, a Democrat, said after an event last week.",

In 2020, Joe Biden flipped it back to the Democrats. Now, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump appear to be in a dead heat in Michigan, and its once again crucial for winning the presidency. For our latest Times Opinion focus group, we gathered a cross-section of Michigan voters to assess the race in the home stretch.The takeaway isnt especially positive for Ms. Harris.Our five independents, four Democrats and two Republicans were clear on a few points: Most want significant change in America under the next president, and the bulk of them cite the economy as their top issue and care more about the candidates policies than their values. One voter was troubled by Ms. Harriss support for arms to Israel and is leaning toward Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Others thought Mr. Trump didnt understand what it meant to struggle financially.Perhaps most worrisome for Ms. Harris, nine of our 11 participants thought she would pursue policies similar to Mr. Bidens. Muhammad, a 25-year-old software engineer and registered independent who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020, said he was struck by a recent TV ad showing Ms. Harris on The View saying she could not think of a thing she would have done differently from Mr. Biden during their administration. For him and others, Harris's problems boil down to two words: \"Change\" and \"Biden.\"I understand not pushing Biden under the bus, but she needs to be more authentic and actually take responsibility for the failures of her administration. She was the border czar, and that is a failure. All she needed to do was be authentic about that, Muhammad said.Some participants were enthusiastic about Ms. Harriss energy and ideas and thought that as a woman, she represented change. But as for who will win Michigan and the presidency, these voters thought the race was trending toward Trump, even though several of them saw him as dangerous and unhinged.",

Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Over the next few days at the Democratic National Convention, Vice President Kamala Harris will accept her partys nomination and reintroduce herself to American voters. Today, my colleague, Astead Herndon, looks at the key periods in Harriss life that explain who she is, what she believes, and the kind of president she might become. Its Monday, August 19. Astead, thank you for coming in here.astead herndonThank you for having me. Im happy to be here.michael barbaroThe strange thing about this election  I mean, there are a lot of strange things about this election.astead herndonIm like, one?michael barbaroOne of the strange things about this election is that we have a Democratic nominee who has been the nominee for, what, four weeks? And did not go through the yearlong public dissection that generally occurs when you run for president and makes everybody very familiar with your life story by the time you become the nominee. And we actually keep hearing that when we go out and report about Harris. A lot of people, theyre interested in her, but they dont really know who she is. And thats why we want to talk to you. We want to tell the story of Kamala Harris in as full a way as possible. And you have spent the past couple of years doing that, not knowing that we would arrive at this moment, but just because it was a story that you got really interested in. How do you think about the life story of Kamala Harris?astead herndonYeah. I think there is often an incentive to try to get an easy answer to who is Kamala Harris or what does she believe in. And the thing that I have learned in covering her over this time is that you should resist that desire, that theres not really an easy answer. And the boxes that folks try to put her in, whether it be about identity or about comparison to past politicians, namely Barack Obama, I dont think are really that helpful in terms of understanding someone whose life and track to this point has been really singular.michael barbaroEmbracing that thesis that this is a singular person whos resistant to easy labels, where do you think we should start to try to understand who she really is? Whats the first chapter of this singular story of Kamala Harris?astead herndonI would start in her growing up. She grows up in Oakland in the backdrop of the 1960s Bay Area, and is really shaped by her family and community thats around her. Her mother was a scientist at the University of California Berkeley, and an immigrant from India who came here to learn at the school and meets her father, who is also an academic there and is a Jamaican immigrant. And importantly, theyre activists who were, like many people in that time, active in the Civil Rights Movement. And she tells stories when shes on the trail about going to marches and rallies from times of being in a stroller. I would also say that the multiculturalness and specifically the racial identity of the place she grows up really matters. This is someone who is growing up really around not only just a Black community, but a very prideful, rich history of Blackness.michael barbaroExplain that.astead herndonThe Black Panthers headquarters was blocks from her house. And her parents did a very intentional effort to place their children in Black affirmation spaces. They would go to these classes on the weekends where kids from the community would come and have these Black history lessons. It was called The Cactus Club. And the reason it was called The Cactus Club is because it was about Black people being able to grow in any environment.michael barbaroJust like a cactus.astead herndonYeah. And that lives alongside her also having a really comfortable relationship with the Indian side of her family. I mean, she would travel to India. Her parents family were folks who were fighting for democracy and their independence movements. She would have those conversations with her grandfather. I mean, so it wasnt someone who I think was really only defined by one thing. But it was very much taught from an early age that you exist, Im using a coconut reference, but you exist in the context of both of those things. And so that was very much an intentional effort from her mother. And by the time shes in elementary school, she finds herself as a part of a group of students who are involved in a desegregation program that buses them to a different part of town. Theyre actually the second class of Black Berkeley to be shipped.michael barbaroBig deal.astead herndonYeah. And its something that really shapes her growing up. I talked to one of her friends from growing up. Her name is Cynthia Bagby, who mentioned remembering when her and Kamala Harris, first grade, were at the bus stop being ready to be bused to a different part of town. And Cynthia told me this story about how nervous she was, about how she didnt have white friends and she knew that they were being put in a different situation and environment.michael barbaroTheyre plunged in a completely alien place.astead herndonAbsolutely. But what Cynthia told me was that she remembers a young Kamala Harris being so confident and being so unfazed by this situation that when they got back from school, she noticed how Kamala had already 10 friends, was kind of socially running the place. Everyone loved her after the first day.michael barbaroThe mayor of the new largely white school.astead herndonYeah. And so those were the type of stories that people would tell that not only was there a confidence that flowed, but there was a comfort with herself and her identity that really attracted people to her.michael barbaroAnd that comfort youre describing seems like it would flow pretty directly from the way her parents raised her, the classes they brought her to, and that this is an extremely self-possessed person who knows her spot in the world.astead herndonAbsolutely. I remember asking her once, where did this come from, youre self-belief? And I remember her saying, I was raised to believe that I belong in every room that I am in. And that is the core of Kamala Harriss self-belief. It does not come from the position she has now. It does not come from status gained later in life. It comes from an instilling of confidence and pride that started from the day she was born. And so by the time that Kamala Harris is in high school, she knows that she wants to go to an HBCU to follow in the footsteps not only of people around her, but of historical figures who she admired, like the Thurgood Marshalls of the world. And I think thats an important choice.michael barbaroWhy?astead herndonBecause youre achieving young people of color, theres sometimes an incentive to follow the White institutional elites to X place, go to an Ivy League, go to this or that. A 15-16-year-old with the world in front of them saying, I want to put myself at Howard University isnt a small choice. It is a recognition of who the communities are that matter to them and their belief that Black folks can shape them to be excellent, period.michael barbaroHow does the next chapter of her life, her chosen career as a prosecutor, how does that flow from everything that youre just describing? All this pride in being a member of the Black community. Because in my, perhaps, naive mind, being in law enforcement in the period when shes coming out of Howard, seems like it might be in conflict with being a proud member of a Black community that American law enforcement is increasingly seen as having a very adversarial relationship with.astead herndonYeah, I think this comes up all the time. And to be clear, it came up when she was growing up. I mean, when I talk to people from Oakland, they say that when young Kamala Harris, theyre shining community star, decided to become a prosecutor, it was a topic of conversation among her family and friends. Like, what you doing, sis?michael barbaroAnd what was her answer?astead herndonShes talked about this a lot in speeches and interviews, and taken people through how she thinks about this decision.archived recording (kamala harris) When it came time to make my career choice, my family gathered around. And they said, Kamala, what are you going to do in your fight for justice? And I got all excited. And I said, Ive decided Im going to be a prosecutor. If you have any sense of who my family is, you will know that at best they found it a curious decision. And with some of them, I had to defend the decision like one would a thesis.astead herndonShe knew she was making a controversial choice.archived recording (kamala harris) I believe safety is a civil right. A civil right to which all people are entitled. And lets talk about a myth, a myth that Black people dont want public safety. That is simply not true.astead herndonAnd part of the reason she gives is that minority communities and specifically Black people deserve safety.archived recording (kamala harris) And I said, why is it that we should only be on the outside of systems? Isnt there a role also for us to play on being on the inside, where the decisions are being made?astead herndonAnd to go back to context, I think its important to recognize this is the 1980s. This is a generation of Black people that are coming after the Civil Rights Movement that have access to institutions and halls of power for the first time. And for a lot of those people, there was a real ethos of, you need to do something with that. You need to wield these instruments of power to be more responsive to Black communities. You could enter those halls and make them things that worked for Black people.michael barbaroWhat does it look like once she gets inside these halls of power, actually becomes a prosecutor? How does she put this philosophy about representation and change into practice?astead herndonShe runs for district attorney in San Francisco. And she, frankly, makes her whole public pitch around this idea that its not empathetic to say, dont lock anybody up. And so thats how she wins that first race. But she also does it, I think, through representing a vision of the future rather than past. Her identity is laced into that argument. The fact that shes young, the fact that shes a person of color, the fact that she is a woman are all things that really matter. It is not about the identity, but that has always been an implicit part of the pitch. She was making an argument that was about the policy.michael barbaroNot about her identity, but her identity obviously came with the package of her as a candidate.astead herndonYes, comes with the package of the candidate and is part of the reason that shes arguing that these institutions can do something different is because I represent something different. And once she wins office, what it looks like for her to put this into practice is a set of policies that I think really add up to the earliest versions of what we now call a Progressive prosecutor. She says that you can be focused on delivering safety and accountability while you also look at root causes or try to be empathetic to people, in a way that separates herself from what, I would describe, as the crime bill, Joe Biden, Bill Clinton, 1990s view of the world.michael barbaroWhats a good example of this?astead herndonOne example I would say is the Back On Track Program that she started. That was one of the first to allow formerly incarcerated felons to find their way back into the workforce. Shes really proud of that. Thats obviously been something thats been taken nationally at this point. I think its just the thing that people agree on should happen.michael barbaroThat there needs to be a bridge between prison and the rest of your life.astead herndonBut that, at the time, was kind of spicy. And thats one of the things that she piloted. The other thing I would say and the thing that blew up is what she was doing around the idea of truancy or the chronic absence of children in schools. One of the things that happened in the time when she was prosecutor was there were some data that came out that showed that people who are incarcerated usually missed a bunch of school in their time of growing up, that early absences in childhood were indicative of someone who might have future criminal justice problems. And so there was a question of what to do about that.archived recording 1 Joining us to explain how truancy impacts the entire family is San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris. It is great to have you with us.astead herndonAnd from a prosecutors vantage point, she actually tried to take this problem on.archived recording (kamala harris) And what weve done is we started an initiative a couple of years ago that involved me assigning prosecutors to go and meet with the teacher when they met with the parent. And so the prosecutors there and the parent says, whos that mean looking person? And they say, thats the prosecutor, because if we cant fix this problem, they may end up prosecuting you. But by the way, the way we want to fix the problem is weve got all these services for you.astead herndonShe used her role to Institute a series of policies that would hold the parents accountable for chronically absent children.archived recording (kamala harris) And its been fantastic, because when the principal would otherwise call the parent and say, Miss Smith, Johnnys not in class. Would you return my call? Call went unanswered. Now, the principal calls and says, Miss Smith, Johnnys not in class. And by the way, that DA Kamala Harris has said she might prosecute you and send you to jail. And that call gets returned.astead herndonBasically, after a series of warnings, charging the parents if their kids miss enough school under the idea of it would make the kids come more frequently and stop them from getting involved in the criminal justice system kind of before it becomes a big problem. And while that could be good in theory, the reality was that this resulted in a targeting of Black, low income, people of color.michael barbaroThe very people that she thinks of herself as trying to improve the lives of.astead herndonAbsolutely. There were a couple of instances, particularly when the program was adopted by other places, that resulted in parents being perp walked, that resulted in charging certain parents. And I think it had the stench of punitive meanness that was already coming down on people who had a lot of problems.michael barbaroWhat do you make of that?astead herndonTo me, its indicative of a worldview that is reflective of a prosecutor. I think if youre a mayor, a city councilor, Senate, or House, youre used to seeing problems from a 360 lens and you get afforded the space to come up with a vision to solve them. Thats not really what prosecutors do.michael barbaroThey charge or they dont.astead herndonThey react. They hold people accountable. Its about law enforcement. And so this example of truancy is one of the times she tries to take that law enforcement view of the world and apply it to root causes of a problem. And so I think you can see it from a lot of different vantage points. And one way, its a Progressive prosecutor thinking about how can I attack a problem at its root. Thats a really kind of progressive thought. But at the same time, what she did with that was kind of punitive. It was not something that really attacked the full scope and then I think had the impact of, frankly, reinforcing some of the same tropes about these parents and these communities that Im pretty sure she wants to avoid. And I think that shows the limits of that kind of accountability viewpoint.michael barbaroOr perhaps even the contradictions of it. But she seems comfortable with those contradictions. That on some level, yes, shes trying to solve a problem at its root, insofar as shes able to do it. And it might actually result in some parents getting in some real trouble, parents in the Black community shes there to try to protect and improve the lives of, but shes kind of made peace with that.astead herndonI think so to a certain extent. For one, on truancy, she does back off. And so I do think that there were academics and Progressives who reached out to that office to say that you are making a mistake. And some of that eventually landed. But I do think that there is a sense of comfort with the idea that harm creates consequences. And some people are going to get locked up.michael barbaroAnd you might not like me for it.astead herndonAnd you might not like me for it, but I think you like the results of it. And I think her view of the world is accountability can be empathetic. And she rides this approach to the attorney generals office and then eventually to the US Senate. And shes comfortable with that approach. Its when she goes to Washington and eventually runs for president when a lot of this becomes uncomfortable.michael barbaroWell be right back. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Astead, take us into the next chapter of this story here. Kamala Harris as a Democratic candidate for president, when this record of hers as a prosecutor, as you just said, becomes less comfortable for her.astead herndonYeah, I think about the 2016 election. On that night, she was all but guaranteed to be the next senator from California.michael barbaroShe wins the US Senate seat the night of the Clinton versus Trump election?astead herndonYes. And there was a sense among Democrats that not only would Hillary Clinton win, but Clinton would be a transition to a next coming of Democratic stars.michael barbaroBut a few years down the road.astead herndonA few years down the road.michael barbaroBut, of course, thats not how that night goes. Donald Trump wins. And very immediately, Democrats are thrust into this mass resistance where they are searching for someone who can become the face of leading the party out of the rubble. And so she goes from being someone who should have six years to start to understand Washington, to someone who is being floated as a possible 2020 presidential candidate. Its a real sea change in the trajectory that she was supposed to have. And as shes having this open discussion about whats happening next, she has a couple viral moments that make her a celebrity. The Supreme Court confirmation hearings.archived recording (kamala harris) Can you think of any laws give government the power to make decisions about the male body? archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Uh.astead herndonI think Kavanaugh really encapsulated a lot of that.archived recording (brett kavanaugh) Im happy to answer a more specific question. archived recording (kamala harris) Male versus female. archived recording (brett kavanaugh) There are medical procedures.astead herndonThe way she was going at Jeff Sessions and Trump figures of the time.archived recording (kamala harris) Sir, I have just a few  archived recording (jeff sessions) Will you let me qualify it? If I dont qualify it, youll accuse me of lying. I need to be correct as best I can. archived recording (kamala harris) I do want you to be honest. archived recording (jeff sessions) Im not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous.astead herndonAnd she becomes a hero for a lot of these folks and a driver of Democratic fundraising. And so it elevates you from someone who people are talking about in the background to being someone who is seen as a star of the party. And that only furthers the question of running for president. And frankly, I think cements it. And so by the time that she is actually putting her hat in the ring, the campaign comes up with a strategy that I think is reflective of the things we were talking about before. They dont want to choose an ideological lane. They want her to be everything to everyone. And they think that they can do that in this race.michael barbaroAnd be true to herself.astead herndonAnd be true to herself.archived recording (kamala harris) Whats up, Oakland? [LAUGHS]astead herndonAnd I remember the announcement speech she gave in Oakland where there was 20,000 people outside.archived recording (kamala harris) It was just a couple of blocks from this very spot, nearly 30 years ago as a young district attorney, I walked into the courtroom for the first time and said the five words that would guide my lifes work, Kamala Harris for the people.astead herndonAnd she told a very clear story about why she became a prosecutor, about what her vision was going forward.archived recording (kamala harris) I knew our criminal justice system was deeply flawed. But I also knew the profound impact law enforcement has on peoples lives and its responsibility to give them safety and dignity. I knew I wanted to protect people. And I knew that the people in our society who are most often targeted by predators are also most often the voiceless and vulnerable. And on that point, I believed then, as I do now, no one should be left to fight alone. [CHEERING]astead herndonAnd I think was really reflective of the vision of what that campaign thought they could do.michael barbaroAnd the story youve been telling here.astead herndonAnd the story weve been telling here. The problem was thats not how that primary went. It wasnt a primary that was really about working with institutions to make marginal gains.michael barbaroIt was about blowing them up to a degree.astead herndonYeah. And over the next several months archived recording 2 Good evening, Senator. Thank you for being here. You position yourself as aligned with the Progressive movement to make criminal justice less punitive and racist. Yet, your record as a prosecutor shows that you embrace the tough-on-crime mentality.astead herndonAs activists are creating litmus tests about what progressive means, about what constitutes criminal justice reform archived recording 3 Will you support the Bernie Sanders bill, which essentially gets rid of insurance? archived recording (kamala harris) I support Medicare for all, but I really do need to clear up what happened on that stage. It was in the context of saying, lets get rid of all the bureaucracy. Lets get all of the ways  archived recording 3 Not the insurance companies? archived recording (kamala harris) No. Thats not what I meant. I know it was astead herndon forcing her to answer more specific questions about what health care systems should look like and things like that.michael barbaroThis is the year where the moderators are always asking the Democratic candidates on the debate stage to raise their hand if they think that private health insurance should go away.astead herndonYeah.archived recording 4 Youve been asked to clarify this question a couple of times over the course of the campaign. Once and for all, do you believe private insurance should be eliminated in this country? archived recording (kamala harris) No. archived recording 4 You dont? archived recording (kamala harris) No, I do not. archived recording 4 But you raised your hand last night. archived recording (kamala harris) The question was, would you give up your private insurance for that option? And I said, yes. archived recording 4 I think you heard it differently than others then. archived recording (kamala harris) Probably, because thats what I heard.astead herndonAnd the primary became more and more about structural change and about how you articulate policy visions. She fell further and further behind, partly because thats not how she functions. And so at the time and when she was supposed to introduce herself to the country, I think the campaign was telling a fairly inconsistent story about who she was personally and who she was ideologically, and people werent really responding to that. And that feeling ends up overtaking the campaign.archived recording 5 We are confirming that Senator Kamala Harris plans to drop out of the 2020 presidential race. archived recording 6 Miss Harris entered the race as a major force on the campaign trail. You recall she had a huge crowd in Oakland. But she failed to capitalize on that early enthusiasm and plummeted in the polls. [UPBEAT MUSIC]michael barbaroThat race and the way youre describing it, Astead, makes me want to understand what happened to that self-confident person who doesnt want to check the boxes and knows who she is, and says, accept me on my own terms. Obviously, one of the answers are the debate stages and the litmus tests you just mentioned. But we all know what happened in that race. The person who won the Democratic primary astead herndonWas the person who flipped all those tests off.michael barbaroAnd the person who sounded the most like Kamala Harris, Joe Biden. Equally associated with moderate politics, law and order, defending the police, and working within the system. She could have done what he did.astead herndonAbsolutely. It wasnt as if those positions were incompatible with the Democratic electorate. But what Joe Biden was willing to do in that primary that Kamala Harris wasnt was tell those Progressive groups to  they flipped them off. He told them, I dont care what your litmus tests are. This is who I am. Youre going to take this experience. And most importantly, Joe Biden was telling a consistent story about electability. I can beat Trump, and thats what you need to focus on. That was not where other people were. And most importantly, Harris was pulled away from what I think that self-confidence was.michael barbaroIt goes back to this idea perhaps that this just happened too fast. She wasnt ready.astead herndonI think so. When youre a journalist asking Bernie, Biden, even Warren, a question, theyve spent so much time thinking about running for president and their worldview, they return to a core belief. They return back to a basic, fundamental understanding they have about why problems are the way that they are. And no matter what question you ask, even if they dont fully know, theyre going to return back to that core. What was missing from Harris, in my opinion of 2020, was that sense of core. And so when she was asked questions on arenas she was uncomfortable in, you could feel her swimming for an answer. And I think that read as inauthentic. And particularly when youre not a figure that people already know. And so in her moment of introducing herself to the country, she was the most distant from the person shes always been. And I think that gap is what doomed that campaign.michael barbaroAnd then, of course, out of the ashes of this pretty abject failure of a campaign comes the vice presidency.astead herndonYeah. And I think its important to remember how she drops out in a way that I think was really sudden for people. And almost immediately, you saw the tide of sympathy turn in the Democratic Party.michael barbaroToward her?astead herndonToward her.michael barbaroFascinating.astead herndonPeople saying, maybe we were too hard on her. And that started immediately. And so by the time Joe Biden becomes someone whos looking for a VP and then, importantly, makes a pledge to choose a woman in that summer, a lot changes between the time that Biden becomes the nominee and the time in which hes selecting a VP. You have not only the onset of the pandemic and the shutdown of the country, but you also have the explosion of the racial justice protests that happened after George Floyds murder. And so the conversation around Bidens VP selection gets wrapped up in both of those facts. And you have a pretty open debate among the party about whether he has to choose a Black woman.michael barbaroNow theres pressure not just to choose a woman, but to choose a Black woman.astead herndonAnd so I think there was a feeling that if you did not choose Kamala Harris, you were skipping over the most qualified Black woman. And so the campaign chooses Harris. And I think its important to remember it was their best fundraising day that they had all year when they chose Harris.michael barbaroBut the result of this, and I want you to correct me if Im in any way wrong about this, is that shes being put in something of an identity box. And she doesnt like identity boxes.astead herndonIts true. And I think that she does not like being identity first as the reason shes in the room, even if thats part of her worldview. It is a very understandable feeling to say, I dont want to be here only because Im a Black-South Asian woman, period. And it created a situation where the DEI hire framing that, obviously, Republicans have latched on to, was always in the air with her selection. And I think, frankly, it reflects the thinking of the Biden inner circle at the time, the underestimation they had of both her and I think their misconceptions about the political moment at large.michael barbaroExplain that.astead herndonI think its most clear in the policy portfolios she takes on. She was assigned what, I think, is universally seen as a horrible electoral platform, which is the root causes of migration in certain Central American countries.michael barbaroRight. Its like asking someone to solve the greatest riddle in the last 50 years of American foreign policy.astead herndonTotally.michael barbaroAnd Harris knew this was an electoral loser. She actually asked out of the assignment. [LAUGHS]: Can I have something else, please?astead herndonYeah. And Biden made clear, no, this is what I want you to do. And it has immediate impacts.archived recording (kamala harris) I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border astead herndonThink about the infamous press conference she had with the president of Guatemala talking about immigrants.michael barbaroYep.archived recording (kamala harris)  do not come. Do not come.astead herndonThe interview she had with Lester Holt about whether she went to the border or not. There was an understanding that this was a political loser, but it was something that they tasked her with and that she, frankly, just had to soldier on from. The other thing that happens, and I think this is natural with VP office versus West Wing, was there was a push and pull about which events to use her at, particularly in the first couple of years. And to the point about not being want to be put in a box of race and gender, there was a story I heard about a time in which the West Wing wanted her to be used at this event where there was a baby formula shortage that was national news.michael barbaroTotally.astead herndonAnd the administration was doing some efforts to try to make sure they could get more formula. And there was a plane landing that was filled with formula. And the administration wanted to do a photo op taking credit for solving baby formula crisis. Classic political maneuver. And they asked Harris to go. And, again, to the point about when is identity helpful versus when does it put you in a box? This is something she didnt want to do.michael barbaroBe kind of womaned.astead herndonYeah, be put in that box. And I think it reflects the hard choices that sometimes identity can put you in. And so particularly in those first couple of years, that was a push and pull between her and White House. But she largely takes on the assignments that the White House gives her. And most importantly, she maintains an intense sense of loyalty to President Biden that he really appreciates. And so it matters to him that she says, yes, when he reassigns her that immigration assignment, and that she goes to Guatemala, and she does those things right.michael barbaroShe does almost all the things.astead herndonShe does the things that are required of her. The impact is that for the first couple of years of her as VP, shes still dealing with some of the clouds that hung over her during the presidential race. There is a sense that you dont really know what shes doing or what she believes in. But I think that really starts to change around 2022.archived recording (kamala harris) This is the first time in the history of our nation that a constitutional right has been taken from the people of America.astead herndonAfter the Dobbs decision, it creates a lane for her in the administration that she really latches on to.archived recording (kamala harris) I do know that the American people fight for freedom and believe in the womans right to make decisions about her own body.astead herndonAnd she becomes the spokesperson for the administration on the issue and becomes the liaison between abortion rights groups and the White House.archived recording (kamala harris) What has happened here in Arizona is a new inflection point. It has demonstrated once and for all that overturning Roe was just the opening act, just the opening act of a larger strategy to take womens rights and freedoms.astead herndonShe starts embracing the language of freedoms and Democrats protecting reproductive rights.archived recording (kamala harris) And now, because of Donald Trump, more than 20 states in our nation have bans. Now, because of Donald Trump, one in three women of reproductive age in our country live in a state that has a Trump abortion ban.astead herndonThe stump speech was better. It just clarified her pitch because she can go back to something that a lot of people really care about and, most importantly, is at the top of Democrats list. And so I think the first couple of years are education in Washington that may not have happened before she was running for president. But what happened after that was she traveled across the country and, I think, took on a lot of the campaigning efforts that Biden was not doing. And so as a result, she became someone who was more comfortable doing those interactions in a place she wasnt in 2019.michael barbaroAnd perhaps this is why shes ready for what ends up being this extraordinary moment that she encounters a couple of weeks ago.astead herndonYeah, and I think a lot of people were surprised at the speed at which the party unified around her. But it is explained a little more by the work shes done over the last couple of years. When she was going to events as VP, she was calling DNC members and creating those relationships. She was checking in with donors. She was growing a backroom reputation of someone who could lead the party, if necessary. And so when Biden drops and endorses her, she leaned on all of those things to really coalesce support very quickly. And I think there was a greater willingness to see her as someone who could step up to the top of the ticket, because of the advocacy she was doing on issues like abortion over the last couple of years. And so she laid the foundation to really seize that opportunity once it arrived.michael barbaroAnd yet, thats the story of party insiders rallying around her, perhaps a step because of what she did over the past two years as vice president. But it still feels true that the American public doesnt really know what she stands for and exactly who she is. And at this point, its unclear whether thats going to matter in a race where there was so much unhappiness about Biden and Trump. But thats an unusual thing, as we said at the beginning of this conversation.astead herndonYeah. I mean, a lot of the work we are talking about, to your point, is insider political stuff. For most people, I think she was running for president, she became vice president, kind of went away, and now shes the nominee. And so I think that is the reason why Republicans are trying to paint her as flimsy and nonsubstantive. And although at this moment, shes been able to step away from 2019 and say, that wasnt the real version of me, I do think it leads to the question, what is then? And I think over the next three months, the onus is on the campaign to tell that story. And I think that starts at the DNC.michael barbaroLets talk about that story for just a second, because there is a clear story to tell of a young girl who grows up in Black Oakland, child of activists, becomes a prosecutor in the name of bringing that identity and pride inside an institution that she thinks needs to change with her at the center of that change, and the application of that approach of hers to criminal justice, an approach that, like Harris herself, defies being easily put into boxes. Its the story of somebody who believes you can be multiple things at the same time. You can be an empathetic Progressive, but also believe in punishment and in accountability. But my question is, is that a story which we know she didnt want to tell in 2019-2020, that she wants to tell now? The story that you have been telling us here.astead herndonYes.michael barbaroIs that going to be at the center of her campaign?astead herndonYes. I think that the biggest change from 2019 to now is a comfort with that story and a political moment thats more ready to receive it. And so already she has said the words prosecutor maybe more than she said in four years ago. And with Donald Trump on the other side, a convicted felon with looming charges, accountability is on the comeback. And she was going to own that type of framing.michael barbaroA story very faithful to who Kamala Harris was that was hard to sell last time she ran and that she kind of ran away from, now feels like the story she should be embracing and that the country might very much embrace.astead herndonYeah. I think she will return to that articulation. And so the moment of unity were seeing now was always under the surface possible. And I think a lot of that is because she is a vessel that you can see what you want to see in. If you want to see a Progressive, theres enough there you probably can. If you want to see a moderate, you probably can see that too. And so what I think is one of the stories here is a ideological fluidity that was once seen as a problem is now being seen as a solution.michael barbaroAstead, were talking about Kamala Harris here as a candidate in a race thats going to be over in a few months. And youre suggesting that her ideological fluidity might benefit her in a race like this. If she wins, though, the question is going to become, what does that fluidity mean for her as actual president in the hot seat? And what kind of philosophy is this former prosecutor who, as youve laid it out, has always been most comfortable thinking still in the mind of a law and order person? Whats that going to look like when shes commander in chief and leader of the free world?astead herndonAbsolutely. We dont know. But come governing time, all of this fluidity will be put to the test. And we dont know what type of president she would be. I mean, we dont know what the agenda of a Kamala Harris Democratic Party would look like and how that would differ from the one that Biden has laid out. But frankly, if you ask any Democrat, they would say thats tomorrows problem. And as long as she wins the election and stops Donald Trump from winning another term, they dont care. They really dont care.[laughs]Theyll deal with that then.michael barbaroRight. Thats the thing about a tomorrow problem, you deal with it tomorrow.astead herndonYeah. Yeah. Who cares?michael barbaroAstead thank you very much. Really appreciate it.astead herndonThank you for having me. [UPBEAT MUSIC]michael barbaro",

Put 1 tablespoon of the pea mixture in the center and pull all the edges of the dough up and around it into a ball, being careful not to let the outermost edges get wet with filling. Twist and pull the edges together to close them, pinching off all the excess dough at the same time. (Try not to rip the dough, or oil will get inside the kachori when you fry it.

She spent a lot of time in pubs on early '90s London business trips, and the only vegetarian dish was very often a baked potato. This is where she discovered the ingenuity of filling a soft, steamy potato with all kinds of tasty toppings that absorb nicely into the starchy flesh. In this recipe, she subs out the big potato for smaller, thin-skinned ones (for a prettier presentation), and the bacon bits, chives and packaged cheese for spicier, brighter toppings: chiles, chaat masala, onions and ginger. This dish takes almost no time to put together once the potatoes are baked, but looks very impressive as an appetizer or a small side. Tip: Cut the ginger, onion and chiles while the potatoes bake, so everything is ready for assembly. Priya Krishna",

Canned pumpkin works just fine here, but theres nothing like the jack-o-lantern aroma of fresh steamed squash (see Tip). The action of mashing and stirring a fresh pot of rice until the loose grains hold one shape feels almost as if youre kneading bread, though, Mr. Thiam says, a more accurate parallel would be the act of making fufu, the pounded meal thats central to West African cuisine. Make the rice balls whatever size you like; they make excellent finger food, especially dipped in maaf, the velvety, rich Senegalese peanut stew (often called groundnut stew) that tastes like savoriness incarnate.

Every family has their own version, but at its root, lecs is a paprika-spiced stew with melting onions, peppers and tomatoes. The vegetables are simmered together until saucy, jammy and glossy; the sweetness of the onions and peppers is offset by tomatoes, making this an irresistibly balanced dish that is light but satisfying. Hungarian peppers would be ideal. Typically enjoyed at their yellow stage, they are sweet and savory with a mild heat level. Red bell peppers are more modest, with their predominantly sweet flavor, but make a delicious option for this recipe. The dish, adapted from Pass the Plate by Carolina Gelen (Clarkson Potter, 2024), is vegan as written, but you can use this foundational recipe to make it your own. Some people serve it with fried or scrambled eggs, some with sausage or other meats, some use animal fat to cook the vegetables. Each version will bring comfort and flavor to your table.",

I used 2 cups of chicken broth for 1 cup of white basmati rice and cooked for about 28 minutes. It still had not absorbed 100% of the liquid, so I may try a tad below 2 cups next time. I added some spinach at the end and served with a dollop of full-fat greek yogurt mixed with honey and garam masala. A win!Is this helpful?",

These will have a foot similar to a macaron and will appear a deep golden color because of the extra egg yolk. I used a 1T measuring spoon to scoop the dough (2/cookie). This produces a relatively large cookie that is both chewy and cake-like on the inside and crispy outside. As others note, there is a fair amount of spread as they bake. I put 8 cookies each on parchment lined, full sized baking sheet and yielded 20 cookies. 1T/scoop would work well for bite-sized cookies. They are quite sweet. While Im not as in love with these as other commenters, I will absolutely keep them in my recipe box and make them again.

Clip the candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan (its OK if its coated in honey), reduce the heat to medium and boil the mixture without stirring, occasionally swirling the saucepan, until it registers 310 degrees, then remove from the heat immediately. With the mixer running on medium-high speed, stream the sugar mixture into the bowl just as you did the honey. Once youve added all of the sugar mixture, increase the speed to high and continue to beat until the sides of the bowl are warm but not hot and the mixture is very thick, dense and voluminous, about 4 minutes (the mixer might strain against the mixture).",

            "text": "How Does a Pressure Cooker Work?Dating to the 17th century, the first pressurized cooking pot was developed by the French physicist Denis Papin. Basically a pot with a tight-sealing lid and a steam valve, a pressure cooker traps the steam rising from the boiling liquid in the pot, which, in turn, raises the temperature at which that liquid boils. (For example, without pressure, water at sea level boils at 212 degrees. Under pressure, that temperature can rise to as much as 266 degrees.) The higher temperature, combined with the pressure in the pot that forces the hot steam into the ingredients, cooks food much faster than traditional methods.A pressure cooker works at different pressure levels, each one changing the boiling point of the liquid. With most pressure cookers today, the pressure gauge is preset for two options. At low pressure (10 pounds per square inch, or p.s.i.), the internal temperature reaches 235 degrees. At high pressure (15 pounds p.s.i.), it can reach 250 degrees. A steam valve allows excess steam to escape, keeping the pressure cooker from exploding, but, as countless tales of split pea soups on the ceiling attest, it has historically been an imperfect method. Modern pressure cookers  stovetop and electric  are quite safe. They dont explode as your grandmothers may have. But, by eliminating the guesswork, electric pressure cookers take the anxiety out of the process.For a long time, stovetop pressure cookers were the only style available. As the name suggests, theyre heated on the stove, and set to high or low pressure. As the pressure inside increases, the gauge on its lid pops up, indicating that the inside of the pot has reached the optimal pressure. Once there, the heat needs to be adjusted to keep the pots temperature and pressure constant. This is to avoid over-pressurizing (which can burn the food inside or, in extreme cases, explode). It also keeps the pressure and temperature from falling before the food is done. Monitoring the pressure isnt hard, but you do need to keep an eye on it.With an electric pressure cooker, everything is done automatically. Once it reaches the correct pressure and temperature, it will stay there without the cooks having to do anything. For that reason, you can set it and walk away, much as you would with a slow cooker. And dont worry: It wont explode. It will simply turn itself off if the pressure or temperature ever rise too high.",

Brush each donut one by one on all sides - top and bottom - in the melted butter, and then immediately after drop the donut into the cinnamon sugar bowl on both sides to coat the whole donut, gently tossing as needed. Do this one by one. This way the donuts wont absorb the butter and get soggy. And just dropping cinnamon sugar on top of them is really inefficient. 2) Agree with others that 6 TBSPs of melted butter for coating 12 donuts is way too much. You can easily halve it to 3 TBSPs. 3) Agree with others both to be careful about separating ingredients for batter vs coating and that the batter could have more spice! I accidentally put the full 2 TSPs cinnamon in the batter but the donuts smelled and tasted delicious so Id probably do it again on purpose.Is this helpful?",

It relies on bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, and the role of the skin is essential: First, it forms a protective shield when seared, preventing the chicken from drying out in the bubbling liquid as it simmers, and helps build flavor as its fat renders. (Thank the skin for its service and discard it before serving.) The finishing touch of lime adds a nearly imperceptible sour flavor, similar to some Persian stews, that rounds out the braising liquid, which is best enjoyed with bread or basmati rice.",

There are several ways to drop an egg: Beating the eggs lightly will result in both white and yellow swirls, while running a chopstick or wooden spoon through the egg as it cooks will produce long, willowy strands. This recipe calls for dropping the egg into the hot soup and leaving it, which will give you chunks. A tip: If you have a liquid measuring cup with a spout, beat the egg in that, as it will give you more control when pouring the egg into the hot liquid.

I have one tip and one tip only for those who have issues with pork chops tasting bland brine BRINE BRIIIIIIIINE!!! Pork chops like all meat need salt, and its amazing what a simple brine will do for your pork and chicken. We make a simple brine of equal parts (about 1/4 cup) kosher salt and brown sugar and add a few garlic cloves, thyme sprigs, and peppercorns. You can play around with any herbs and flavors you want in your brine. Dissolve the salt and sugar, cool it down (for food safety purposes) and stick the chops in to refrigerate for anywhere from 4-12 hours. You could literally just cook them as is at this point, but a brine elevates a recipe like this as well to be amazing and flavorful. Dont skip brining your chops!!!Is this helpful? 1",

Ground turkey or pork would be just as good, if you prefer. Russets can be substituted for Yukon golds, but their texture will be more grainy and less creamy. Mature spinach or frozen spinach works best here because of its mellow flavor, as opposed to baby spinach, which is more tannic.

I used the brine from 2 - 16 oz pickled jalepeos jars to marinade the pork. I used an Instant Pot at High Pressure for 60 minutes for a 6 lb roast (I doubled the recipe for BBQ and this recipe). Before pressure cooking, I used the saut function and seared the pork on all sides and then I used the Jalepeo brine that this recipe calls for to deglaze the char in the instant pot, this worked as well as a chicken or beef stock. Overall, a great recipe. A friend of mine who said he doesnt really love pulled pork, thoroughly enjoyed it this way! Enjoy!Is this helpful? 2",

            "text": "Grilled cheese is a near-perfect food on its own, but adding bacon, kimchi or, in this case, heaps of caramelized onions really makes it special. Caramelizing onions takes a good half-hour, so save this recipe for when you have a little extra time and company (this recipe serves two). If time permits, you could even prep them ahead in a slow cooker. Rather than layer the grated Gruyre and the warm caramelized onions in the sandwich, you should stir them together before assembling, which guarantees that the cheese will melt evenly throughout and that each bite will contain the perfect ratio of fragrant cheese to jammy onions. A splash of sherry, red-wine or white-wine vinegar added to the onions balances out the buttery flavors, but a side salad dressed with a tangy mustard vinaigrette would do the trick, too. (Watch the video of Ali Slagle making French onion grilled cheese here.)",

One suggestion- the recipe calls for slicing 1/4 inch off of the TOP of the garlic. Ive always roasted garlic by cutting the BOTTOM of the garlic bulb, but did as instructed this time. Immediately, I realized that this was a mistake, as all of the cloves were no longer attached to each other. I tried to hold it all together while getting the little nuggets into the foil, but it was difficult. When I had to squeeze the garlic out, I had to handle each clove individually. Not ideal. Cut the bottom off the cloves will stay connected, and youll just squeeze the whole bulb into the soup. This was delicious, and Ill be making it again later this week for friends.

Delicate brioche is the ideal bread for this pudding, and it is available in most supermarkets, often in the form of hamburger rolls, which are a good size and shape for this dish.
