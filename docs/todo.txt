To Do:
- choose between word2vec and fasttext - Word2Vec
- simplify the portrayal words, choose better portrayal words
- Arbitrary threshold: at least 4000 articles required to train a word embedding model on the newspaper
- All of the newspapers that we scraped (only for israel artilces) that pass the threshold are also either available on CC-NEWS or we did a general scrape too
    - Combine cnn israel corpus with CC-NEWS cnn articles from 2022-2024 (be mindful of how many articles you will end up having)
    - Do the same for aljazeera and cnbc
    - We have extra 18k articles for nyt scraped by Davi, create a unified NYT dataset
    - nypost, washingtonpost, sfchronicle, thetimes (I dont think we have enough articles for these and I dont think they are in CC-NEWS) find a solution or skip
    - we have enough articles for reuters but they are only from the israeli context, maybe find a general reuters corpus, or create one
- Make sure there is a standard date that we include articles for individual newspaper corpuses
(you cannot have 4000 articles from 2007 for cnn, and 4k articles from 2024 for nyt)
- Choose total of 20 newspapers to train individual word embedding model on (choose some from the CC-NEWS and some from the ones we scraped)
- Train a word embedding model on the 20 newspapers + get the word counts word necessary words

(the following tasks can be done before of after the previous tasks)
- implement a word embedding model on pytorch to enable GPU acceleration
- decide on how to do year-by-year word embedding analysis on CC-NEWS (ie. dataset is too big, are you going to divide/filter, if so how? & train the models)
- check out doc2vec
